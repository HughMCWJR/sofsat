                    <span class="sofsat">SOFSAT</span>, or Setlike Operator-based Framework for Semantic Analysis of Text, works with ideas taken from set theory,
                    which consists of operations on unordered collections of items. Such operators are intersection and difference, where intersection
                    finds the similarities between two sets, and difference finds the unique elements in a set. <span class="sofsat">SOFSAT</span> is a novel framework,
                    first proposed by Dr. Karmaker, which consits of  <span class="op">TextIntersect</span>, <span class="op">TextDifference</span>, and <span class="op">TextUnion</span>.
                    These operators act like their mathematical counterparts, but are designed specifically for semantic analysis of natural language text.
                    For full details, look at the paper <a href="https://karmake2.github.io/files/Publications/2018/SOFSAT.pdf">here.</a>

                    On this site, we demo the first (small-scale) working iteration of the <span class="sofsat">SOFSAT</span> framework.
                    We focus on two set-like operators, <span class="op">TextIntersect</span> and <span class="op">TextDifference</span>.
                    <span class="op">TextIntersect</span>, when provided two documents, finds the common information present in both documents.
                    On the other hand, an operation of LeftSide <span class="op">TextDifference</span> RightSide would find the elements present in the
                    LeftSide document that were not in the RightSide document.

                    Two separate articles from two very different publishers are written about the same topic. Our <span class="sofsat">SOFSAT</span>
                    framework is able to find the similarities and differences between the two articles. This effectively shows the bias
                    that each side has, as well as the core ideas of the story.

                    Reporting biases from the "Left" are represented by coloring the text blue, while reporting biases from the "Right" are represented by coloring the text red. Text that
                    is core to the story, as determined by our <span class="op">TextIntersect</span> operator, is colored green.

                <h2>Data</h2>
                <p>
                    Data for this project was collected from <a href="https://www.allsides.com/story/admin">Allsides.com</a>, a website
                    that gathers political news articles from both the "Left" and the "Right." It also gets stories from less biased, "Center" sources,
                    as well as writing a "Theme" that describes the common topic of the three articles.
                    We use this data to experiment with and evauluate our model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although we focused on political news stories for this demo, the idea of these text operators could be used in
                    many different fields. Real datasets are scarce in this
                    field currently, hopefully encouraging the research community to contribute data in this direction.
                    Our results show promising signs for future research. Our plan for future research is to integrate the current
                    state of the art Neural Network model to see whether it improves the performance.
