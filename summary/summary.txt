This week the regional Director of Region 10, which oversees Bessemer’s election, has ruled that they should rerun that election. Amazon had gotten USPS to set up a mailbox in the parking lot outside of the warehouse. The objections were many that the union filed over Amazon’s behavior during the mail-in balloting period. Amazon had been pushing for an in-person vote but it was the height of COVID and the NLRB had ruled against that, so this mailbox was seen as an attempt to get around that. So those votes are being set aside and it is likely a rerun will happen in the spring. And in fact it’s very concerning for all of us that Amazon could actually pressure a public agency, USPS, to install a mailbox. You can’t have sloganeering at a polling site. So, the workers were correct. Amazon can request that the board review this ruling again but odds are at this point—the hearing officer in August who had overseen this election recommended a rerun. So this was a violation of what the NLRB refers to as laboratory conditions.
