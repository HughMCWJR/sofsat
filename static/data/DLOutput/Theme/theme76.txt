Senator Al Franken has faced much controversy this week after Leeann Tweeden accused him of sexual harrassment on a USO tour in 2006. President Trump tweeted about this report saying, "the Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words." Some people have gone on to criticize Trump's tweet and the White House's response while others have argued that the focus should be on Franken, not on Trump.
