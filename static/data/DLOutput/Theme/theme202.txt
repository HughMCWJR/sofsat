Senators voted late Friday to reject a House-passed bill that would have funded the government until February 16. Although the voting did not fall completely along party lines, most Democrats voted against the bill in hopes of negotiation on "Dreamers," while many Republicans were making arguments related to child healthcare funding. Many on the Left are blaming the Trump administration and Republicans for the shutdown, while those on the Right blame Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
