Many politicians, members of the media, and other public figures are offering condolences as well as opinions in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history that left at least 58 dead and 500 others injured in Las Vegas Sunday night. Many people on the Left are calling for stricter gun legislation and for Congress to act quickly in response to the shooting. Conversely, many on the Right are saying that the event should not be politicized until all information has been acquired and the dust has settled.
