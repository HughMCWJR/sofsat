Illinois just passed a law making Aug. 4th "Barack Obama Day." Gov. Bruce Rauner, a member of the Republican Party, signed the measure, which is intended to "honor the 44th President of the United States of America" who "dedicated his life to protecting the rights of Americans and building bridges across communities."
