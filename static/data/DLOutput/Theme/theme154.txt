Motel 6 is facing controversy after a report revealed that employees in Phoenix, Arizona locations were handing over guest information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). A spokeswoman for the motel chain has since said that the employees have stopped working with ICE employees after the report was released and senior management was made aware of the situation.
