A group of white nationalists descended upon the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA on Saturday to protest the removal of a Confederate statue. Members of the alt-right movement drove a car into crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring nineteen. Trump drew ire across the aisle for his response to the attack, failing to denounce the white supremacist movement and saying that "many sides" were to blame.
