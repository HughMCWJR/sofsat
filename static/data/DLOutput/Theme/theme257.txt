Outgoing director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Richard Cordray announced that he would appoint his chief of staff, Leandra English, to deputy director on Friday.

There is little precedent for these conflicting appointments as each side now argues their case for why they should get to appoint the deputy director.
