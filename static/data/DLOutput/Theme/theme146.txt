Senator John McCain announced today that he would vote no on the latest Obamacare repeal bill, also known as the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Many publications have noted that this likely means the bill is dead and will not move forward. McCain said in a statement that he, "cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal," as it had not gone through a bipartisan, rigorous debate process.
