Nikki Haley, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, says the the United States will stay in the Iran nuclear deal for now. President Trump did not certify that Iran is in compliance, and handed the issue to Congress which has 60 days to decide if it should reinstate economic sanctions. Trump, Haley and Rex Tillerson, US Secretary of State, all pointed to problems with the deal and their concerns about Iran's compliance.
