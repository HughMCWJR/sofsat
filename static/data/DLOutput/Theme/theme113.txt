A predominantly black school in Mississippi named after Jefferson Davis, the Confederate President, will be renamed in honor of Barack Obama. "The school community wanted to rename the campus to reflect a person who fully represents ideals and public stances consistent with what we want our children to believe about themselves," said PTA president Janelle Jefferson.
