The annual Emmy Awards were held last night with Stephen Colbert hosting the prime-time television awards ceremony. Many people were surprised by the appearance of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer who made a joke about the size of the Emmys crowd. There has been a lot of response in the media today to this appearance as well as the many mentions of President Donald Trump during the show. Many writers on the left have argued that Spicer's appearance was not appropriate, while some on the right have found fault with the politicization of the show.
