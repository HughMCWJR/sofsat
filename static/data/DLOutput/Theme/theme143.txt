Today, North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho told reporters outside the United Nations in New York that, "since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to ... shoot down United States strategic bombers." This statement came after a week of General Assembly meetings in New York in which Ri made a speech that referred to President Trump as a "mentally deranged person full of megalomania." Trump responded to the speech with a tweet that said the foreign minister and Kim Jong-un "won't be around much longer."
