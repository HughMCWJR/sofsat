As anti-government protests continue in Iran, President Trump tweeted that it is "time for change". He continued, stating that "the people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their 'pockets.' The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!"
