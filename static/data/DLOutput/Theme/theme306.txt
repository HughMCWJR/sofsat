Walter Shaub, the outgoing head of the Office of Government Ethics, told the New York Times that the U.S. is "close to a laughingstock" when it comes to ethical standards. Shaub announced earlier this month that he would be leaving the Office of Government Ethics. The White House issued a statement saying that Shaub was more interested in "grandstanding and lobbying" than advising the executive branch on ethics.
