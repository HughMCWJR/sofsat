On Friday, President Trump gave a speech to a group of police officers that received a lot of media backlash. In his speech, the President told police officers, "please don't be too nice," and referred to members of the MS-13 gang as "animals." Sources such as Vox and Vanity Fair claimed that the speech was "alarming" and "fearmongering." In response, Fox News released an article claiming that these sources were being biased in favor of gang members.
