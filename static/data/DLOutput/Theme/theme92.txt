After a gunman in Texas shot and killed at least 26 people in a church before being chased off by a local who shot back, there were many political reactions. Some called for gun control, others pointed to mental illness and were thankful that there was someone there to shoot back to save lives, others criticized politicizing the tragedy so early before families had a chance to understand what happened.
