CAIRO/ISTANBUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Monday for a New Year's Day mass shooting in a packed Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, an attack carried out by a lone gunman who remains at large.
It described the Reina nightclub, where many foreigners as well as Turks were killed, as a gathering point for Christians celebrating their "apostate holiday."
The attack, it said, was revenge for Turkish military involvement in Syria.
