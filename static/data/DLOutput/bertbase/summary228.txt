House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) appeared on NBC's "Today" show on Wednesday to discuss the Republican tax bill and the impact it will have on workers, leading host Savannah Guthrie to ask him if he was "living in a fantasy world."
Guthrie expressed skepticism that the bill would lead to higher pay for workers, and to buttress her point she quoted former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: "CEOs aren't waiting on a tax cut to 'jump-start the economy' -- a favorite phrase of politicians who have never run a company -- or to hand out raises," wrote Bloomberg in an op-ed earlier this month.
"It's pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth."
