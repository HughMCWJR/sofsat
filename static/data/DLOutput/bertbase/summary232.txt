Kory Langhofer, the attorney for the Trump for America transition team, sent a seven-page letter to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Oversight Committee, claiming that employees of the GSA "unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel's office."
GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt also contradicted the claims made by Trump's transition team.
The GSA, which holds all the transition documents, handed over the requested "copies of the emails, laptops, cell phones, and other materials" of 13 members of the transition team even though the agency "did not own or control the records in question."
