There's a ticking time bomb built right into the Senate Republican health care bill.
The legislation unveiled Thursday, which Republicans dubbed the Better Care Reconciliation Act, aims to preserve the Affordable Care Act's popular rule forbidding health insurance companies from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions.
But the bill also would repeal that law's unpopular individual mandate that most Americans obtain health coverage or face tax penalties and would significantly scale back financial assistance that helps make health insurance premiums affordable.
