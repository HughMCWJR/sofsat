Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) accused Fox News host Megyn Kelly of being "fascinated by sex" on Tuesday, after snapping at her for asking about the women who have accused Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault.
The exchange on "The Kelly File" was a snapshot of how the Trump campaign is attempting to spin allegations of sexual assault by more than a dozen accusers against their candidate.
He said he was "sick and tired of people like" Kelly using the words "sexual predator" for Trump, who was caught on a 2005 tape bragging how he uses his fame to kiss women or grope them without consent, but now says it was simply "locker room talk."
