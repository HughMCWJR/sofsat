LONDON -- The "specter of aggression" from Russia makes a strong and united NATO more important now than at any time since the Soviet Union's collapse, Vice President Mike Pence said Monday.
"Russia seeks to redraw international borders by force, undermine democracies of sovereign nations and divide the free nations of Europe," Pence said after meeting the leaders of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The three European countries are now members of NATO but were part of the Soviet Union and still feel the pressure of Russian influence after gaining independence in the early 1990s.
