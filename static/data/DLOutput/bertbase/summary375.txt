Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem.
"The California Highway Patrol takes pride in being able to safeguard the rights of every citizen, including freedom of speech and freedom to assemble," the statement said.
From coast to coast, demonstrators are burning flags and effigies of the president-elect while declaring that they refuse to accept Trump's victory.
