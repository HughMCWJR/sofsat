Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which established the regulatory agency, the deputy director is to serve as acting director in the absence of a permanent leader, Mr. Cordray said.
In a letter to the consumer protection agency's staff, Mr. Cordray named Ms. English as deputy director.
Mr. Mulvaney said he would assume the additional role until a permanent successor was found.
