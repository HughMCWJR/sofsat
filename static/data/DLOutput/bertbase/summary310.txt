ANALYSIS/OPINION: Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas have brought forward a formal article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
First, I have slight hope it will inspire an "intervention" in the White House.
If Impeachment is real, if they actually see Articles, perhaps we will see incompetency replaced by care.
