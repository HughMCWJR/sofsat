North Korea appears "primed and ready" to carry out another nuclear test, satellite images suggest, defying President Donald Trump's warning that American could use military force to stop the pariah nation's atomic ambitions.
The satellite images -- taken and published Wednesday -- show increased activity at the reclusive nation's mountainous nuclear test site, according to U.S.-based monitoring group, 38 North.
Just one day earlier, the North warned it would strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons at any sign of aggression from Washington -- although analysts don't believe the country has the ability to do so yet.
