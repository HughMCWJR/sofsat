Protesters across the US were on Friday gearing up for weekend demonstrations over the election of Donald Trump, as other activists began work on plans to disrupt the Republican's inauguration in Washington early next year.
Rowdy protests against Trump and his divisive campaign have spread to cities all over the country following his victory on Tuesday, leading to dozens of arrests and a complaint from Trump in one of his first public remarks as president-elect.
Trump complained in a tweet late on Thursday that "professional protesters, incited by the media" were tarnishing his electoral success, which he said was "very unfair".
