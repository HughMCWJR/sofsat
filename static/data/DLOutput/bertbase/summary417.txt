Boris Johnson has unexpectedly ruled himself out as a candidate for Britain's next prime minister, after the justice secretary, Michael Gove, sent shockwaves through Westminster with a last-minute bid for the Conservative leadership.
Gove had been chairing Johnson's leadership campaign, after the two men worked shoulder to shoulder in the campaign for Britain to leave the EU.
Despite having been the leading public face in the victorious Vote Leave campaign, Johnson quickly concluded he could not command enough support from his party, after a series of key lieutenants, including the business minister Nick Boles and the pro-Brexit MP Dominic Raab, defected to the Gove camp.
