The deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the Trump administration on Sunday to block the president's appointment of Mick Mulvaney as interim director of the agency.
The White House has asserted it has the authority to name its own interim director, all but assuring a tussle at the Wall Street watchdog on Monday with two separate factions contending they run the agency.
The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion on Saturday supporting Mulvaney's appointment.
