The Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal Obama-era regulations protecting net neutrality -- rules that prohibit internet service providers from slowing websites or charging premiums for "fast lanes" for specific services or higher-quality streaming.
Net neutrality should be rolled back, Pai argued in his November proposal, to stop the federal government from "micromanaging the internet."
The FCC is led by longtime net neutrality critic Ajit Pai, who was appointed as a commissioner by President Obama in 2012 and nominated to his current role as chairman by President Trump.
