Instead, it was the result of a fake news story about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign that proliferated on social media in the weeks before Election Day.
The totally false conspiracy theory claims that Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a child sex ring at the basement of a pizzeria in DC, Comet Ping Pong (which doesn't even have a basement).
The scene, thankfully, was not another example of a mass shooting -- no one was injured or killed.
