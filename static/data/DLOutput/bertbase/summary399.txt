Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's powerful denunciation Thursday of "alt-right" extremism that she said GOP opponent Donald Trump embraces was cheered by adherents of the political philosophy.
Clinton, linking Trump with white nationalists and a "radical fringe," delivered a blistering attack on what she said was the alt-right's takeover of the Republican Party.
"She is doing the white nationalism movement a great service by bringing attention to our issues to the forefront of political debate," said William Johnson, a leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party who was selected by Trump as a California delegate during the primary, but later resigned.
