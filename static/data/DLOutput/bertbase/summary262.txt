While the initial impact of Hurricane Harvey may have seemed lighter than expected from a Category 4 storm, the destruction from the lingering storm continues to grow.
Mandatory evacuations have been announced in some Houston neighborhoods, as over 30 inches of rain have fallen in some areas.
On Monday morning, Harvey still ranks as a tropical storm, with sustained winds over 40 mph.
