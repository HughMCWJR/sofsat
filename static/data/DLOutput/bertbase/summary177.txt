Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, had said earlier in the week that he feared that Mr. Trump would play politics with the dueling memos.
In a statement on Friday night, Mr. Schiff said that Democrats had provided their memo to the F.B.I.
and the Justice Department for vetting before it was approved for release by the committee.
