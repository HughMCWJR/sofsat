WASHINGTON -- With his Justice Department and FBI facing broad attacks from some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that he'll stand up to any "unfair" attacks on the men and women of the Justice Department he now oversees.
Such criticism has recently been coming from within Sessions' own party.
Sessions, in a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, mentioned the "sharp criticisms" of DOJ coming from Congress.
