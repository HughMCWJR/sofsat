Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was merely maintaining "decorum and a certain level of civility" on Capitol Hill when he shut down Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for slamming Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra tells Newsmax TV.
"The rules of the Senate I think are very similar to the rules of the House.
"In the House, when your words are taken down, you are prohibited from speaking on the floor for the rest of that legislative day and that's what they did with Elizabeth Warren last night when she went after Jeff Sessions in the way that she did.
