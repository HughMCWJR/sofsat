The White House is considering a draft executive order to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday.
It was unclear whether the order would be enacted by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to pull out from NAFTA - a U.S., Mexico and Canada trade pact - if he cannot win better terms for America.
Instead, Trump will work with Mexico's President Pena Nieto, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to renegotiate the deal, the White House said in a readout of a call between the three leaders.
