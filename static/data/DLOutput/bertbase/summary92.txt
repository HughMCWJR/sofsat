Former President Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden called for action to prevent gun violence in the hours after the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sunday that left 26 people dead and at least 20 injured.
Obama spoke out on Twitter, saying that he stands with the families and survivors.
But he suggested that grieving isn't enough.
