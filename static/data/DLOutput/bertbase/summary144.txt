Photo At a political rally in Alabama on Friday, President Trump had clear advice for N.F.L.
owners if one of their players followed the lead of Colin Kaepernick, the former Super Bowl quarterback who last season began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police injustice against minorities.
Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner who is reportedly among several owners who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural celebrations, said he was "deeply disappointed" by Mr. Trump's comments and defended his players' right to "peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner they feel is most impactful."
