Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced Monday that she would vote against a new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving Republicans at least one vote short of what it would take to pass it -- and dealing what looks like a lethal blow to this latest effort at Obamacare repeal.
Collins announced her opposition in a statement literally minutes after the Congressional Budget Office released a preliminary assessment of the bill introduced by Sens.
and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).
