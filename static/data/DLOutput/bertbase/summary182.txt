The bill would grant legal status to so-called Dreamers, those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
The McCain-Coons bill is a companion bill to the Uniting and Securing America (USA) Act --a bipartisan legislation from Representatives Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.)-- which sought to protect Dreamers from deportation while creating border security plans.
