HOUSTON -- The Green Party officially nominated Massachusetts physician and progressive activist Jill Stein as its presidential candidate on Saturday, also selecting human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.
"We are what democracy looks like and we are what political revolution looks like," Stein said accepting her party's nomination.
Stein also served as the party's standard-bearer in 2012, when she received .9 percent of the national popular vote.
