The cable news network announced late Tuesday night that it will boycott the White House's annual Christmas party for members of the media, news that will come as an early Christmas gift for Trump and his staff.
There will be no armistice in the ugly feud between President Donald Trump and CNN this holiday season.
President Trump on Wednesday called CNN's decision not to attend this year's White House Christmas Party a "great" move.
