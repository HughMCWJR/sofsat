On Thursday, the Tulsa County district attorney charged that officer with first-degree manslaughter for Mr. Crutcher's death.
It has opted for stonewalling.
The Police Department in Tulsa, Okla., made the right choice earlier this week when it released video of an officer shooting and killing an unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher, who could be seen raising his hands above his head during much of the encounter.
