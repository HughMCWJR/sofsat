Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has apparently thrown his support behind the Democrat facing down the embattled Republican Roy Moore in the Alabama special election next week.
The Republican senator, who's retiring at the end of his term in 2018, tweeted a picture of a check written out to Democratic candidate Doug Jones's campaign for $100.
On the memo line, Flake wrote "country over party."
