The remarks at a Group of 7 foreign ministers' meeting here in the Tuscany region of Italy came just before Mr. Tillerson flew to Moscow to meet with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
But Mr. Putin showed no signs of backing away from Mr. Assad.
Mr. Putin, at an appearance with President Sergio Mattarella of Italy, said on Tuesday that the chemical attack was "worth investigating thoroughly," and he said Russia would formally ask the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for an inquiry.
