WASHINGTON -- Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has issued a subpoena to the Trump campaign asking multiple campaign officials to produce Russia-related documents, according to a source with first-hand knowledge of the matter.
The source said the campaign has already turned over some 20,000 documents voluntarily, so it's not clear why the subpoena was issued.
The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also said that the subpoena does not compel testimony by any of the officials.
