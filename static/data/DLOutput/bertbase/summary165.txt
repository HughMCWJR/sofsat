Trump announced Tuesday that he will end Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in six months.
Unless Congress steps in, ending the program could put nearly 800,000 undocumented young people at risk of deportation and unable to work legally when their two-year permits expire.
WASHINGTON -- Former President Barack Obama said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's decision to dismantle the program protecting young undocumented immigrants was "contrary to our spirit, and to common sense."
