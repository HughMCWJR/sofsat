Rep. Al Green (D-TX) became the first member of Congress to officially read articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the floor on Wednesday -- and the president's Twitter account is at the center of Trump's alleged "crimes and misdemeanors."
He told Vox he wanted to give members of Congress and the public "an opportunity to read them" before a vote.
Green's proposal is going nowhere, given that Republicans control the House and Senate and even Democrats have been quick to ridicule the idea that Trump should be impeached anytime soon.
