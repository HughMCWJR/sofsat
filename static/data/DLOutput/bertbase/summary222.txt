Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is publicly criticizing the same tax reform bill that he voted for.
"If I were king for a day, this tax bill would have looked different," Rubio told a reporter who asked him about his overall view of the Republican tax bill, according to News-Press.
Rubio then went on to defend the bill by pointing out that it doubles the Child Tax Credit and claiming that "it is better - significantly better - than the current code."
