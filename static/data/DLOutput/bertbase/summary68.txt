Within minutes of President Trump's nomination of federal judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, several hundred demonstrators had converged on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to protest his selection.
WASHINGTON--President Donald Trump has made his first nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, a federal judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Waving signs proclaiming, "Gorsuch: Extreme and Dangerous" and "#NoWall #NoBan," the protesters and a stream of speakers linked the conservative nominee to the administration's unconstitutional ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, and pledged to defy both.
