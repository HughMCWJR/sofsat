That's according to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who on Thursday explicitly warned the president against meddling with the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.
Should President Donald Trump have special counsel Robert Mueller fired, it could be "the beginning of the end of the Trump Presidency."
The senator said he and a bipartisan group of lawmakers plan to introduce legislation next week that would prevent Trump, and any future president, from firing a special counsel without judicial review.
