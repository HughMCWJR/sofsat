Photo The parents of two Americans killed in the 2012 attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, filed a lawsuit on Monday against Hillary Clinton, saying that her "'extreme carelessness' in handling confidential and classified information" while secretary of state contributed to the conditions that led to their sons' deaths.
In the wrongful-death lawsuit, Patricia Smith and Charles Woods charge that the attack that killed four Americans, including their sons, Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, "was directly and proximately caused, at a minimum" by Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while in the State Department.
The case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch USA on behalf of Patricia Smith, mother of Sean Smith, and Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods, alleges Clinton wrongfully caused the death of their sons.
