"I think the world is still trying to take the measure of this president," said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
President Trump arrives Monday at his first United Nations General Assembly on a mission to cultivate friendships and call out enemies, officials said, with a plan to aggressively put his "America First" agenda into action on the world stage.
Mr. Trump will be pushing reforms to the U.N. and rethinking America's massive contributions, brokering economic deals around the world and trying to inspire global resolve to confront North Korea, Iran, Islamic State and other threats, top aides say.
