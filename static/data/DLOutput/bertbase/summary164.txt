WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers on Capitol Hill broadly agreed on Tuesday that something should be done about young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and who will eventually lose deportation protections if Congress does not step in to help them.

They are willing to vote for protecting so-called "Dreamers" -- but not without getting something in exchange for it.
