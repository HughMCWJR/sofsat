On Monday, the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country.
Called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, it's based on the idea that a fetus at 20 weeks' gestation can feel pain.
While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required, President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes; during the campaign, he said such a bill "would end painful late-term abortions nationwide."
