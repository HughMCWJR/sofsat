Mr. Trump, according to a person briefed on the decision, has not yet formally offered the job to General Kelly, who is out of the country.
The president-elect plans to roll out the appointment next week, along with his remaining national security choices, including secretary of state.
Immigration advocates reacted to the news with measured approval, in large part because Mr. Trump did not choose Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, who is known for his extreme hard-line views on immigration and had been championed for the post by anti-immigration groups.
