Clinton called media coverage of her campaign "unprecedented" and criticized "weaponized information" from fake news sites as major factors in her unsuccessful campaign.
Speaking at the Code Conference in California, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she takes responsibility for her campaign's missteps, while at the same time arguing that she lost last November's election largely for reasons beyond her control.
"I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost," Clinton said.
