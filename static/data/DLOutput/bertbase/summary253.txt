On Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing "sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused."
News of Mr. Lauer's sudden downfall shook the television world, where he had established himself as one of the most powerful men in his industry.
Even President Trump -- who himself has denied multiple allegations of sexual misconduct -- weighed in, seizing on Mr. Lauer's firing to denounce NBC News's coverage and call for other senior figures at NBC News to be ousted.
