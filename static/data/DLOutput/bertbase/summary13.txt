As Trump meets with UK Prime Minister Teresa May, he should expect a cool reception and a reminder that sharing official information like "locker-room talk" threatens the special relationship between British and American intelligence services.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will insist that intelligence shared with the United States must remain secure when she meets with President Donald Trump.
In Brussels on Thursday for a NATO summit at which Trump will also be present, May said she would "make clear" to the U.S. president that leaking of sensitive information to the media must cease, the Press Association reported.
