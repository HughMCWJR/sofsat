U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could soon be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, The New York Times and The Associated Press reported Thursday.
Vanity Fair also cited current and former State Department staffers in a report about Tillerson's potential replacement, saying Pompeo is a more likely successor than UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
Quoting senior administration officials, the Times said Pompeo's role at the CIA would be given to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)
