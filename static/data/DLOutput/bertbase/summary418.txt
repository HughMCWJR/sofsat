Speaking of the gun lobby, if you're still operating under the delusion that the NRA is all about protecting your constitutional liberties, stow it already.
The only legitimate reason it exists in 2016 is to provide a disproportionately sacrosanct, nearly biblical cover for the corporate, for-profit gun manufacturing industry.
Put another way: the Second Amendment is no longer a necessary means of self-preservation, as perhaps it might've been in a rural, agrarian, semi-hostile, slave-holding, post-colonial America.
