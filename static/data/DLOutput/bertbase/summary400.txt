AMATRICE, Italy - Rescue crews using bulldozers and their bare hands raced to dig out survivors from a strong earthquake that reduced three central Italian towns to rubble Wednesday.
The death toll stood at 159, but the number of dead and missing was uncertain given the thousands of vacationers in the area for summer's final days.
"I believe the toll will rise."
