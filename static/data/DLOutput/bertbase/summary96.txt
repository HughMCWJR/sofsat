said "yes," she believes the 2016 Democratic nomination for president was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton, and that the party faces "a real problem" in dealing with the fallout from the revelation that Clinton's campaign secretly took over control of the Democratic National Committee in 2015.
Responding to the disclosure by Donna Brazile, who became interim chairwoman of the DNC as last year's election approached, Warren told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that Democratic leaders must restore faith in the party's operations.
