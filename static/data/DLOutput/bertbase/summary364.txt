Ever since he announced his candidacy to lead the Democratic National Committee, Keith Ellison, the first American Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress, has been the target of a defamation campaign that is deceitful, repugnant, and yet quite predictable.
Three days ago, the now ironically named Anti-Defamation League pronounced Ellison's 2010 comments about Israel "deeply disturbing and disqualifying."
He said in a 2010 speech that while he "wanted the U.S. to be friends with Israel," the U.S. "can't allow another country to treat us like we're their ATM."
