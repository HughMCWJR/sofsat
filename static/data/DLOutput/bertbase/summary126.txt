Authorities say Paddock bought at least 12 bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic rifles to act like machine guns, capable of firing hundreds of rounds a minute.
Investigators believe the devise was used in Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who killed killed 59 people, including himself, and injured at least 500 people.
Legislators are now introducing a bill to deal with bump stocks, but many are saying that Congress must go far further.
