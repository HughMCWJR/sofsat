A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016, upheld a federal law banning medical marijuana users from purchasing guns.
Although medical-marijuana use is legal in California, 24 other states and Washington, D.C., the federal government still bans all use of the drug, and in 1968 Congress prohibited illegal-drug users and addicts from buying and possessing firearms.
Federal law still allows some other groups of potentially dangerous people, including those on the government's "no-fly" list of suspected terrorists, to buy guns.
