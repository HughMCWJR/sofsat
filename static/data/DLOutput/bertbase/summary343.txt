President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed Friday on a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities in the presidential election -- after he spent this week still questioning the veracity of their previous assessments.
"Hacking was only part of it," he said about Russia's cyber activities during the election.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that an unclassified version of the report will be made public early next week.
