Mr. Ri's reference to the declaration of war appeared to refer to Mr. Trump's assertion in a Twitter message over the weekend that the North Korean leadership may not "be around much longer" if it continues its threats.
North Korea last shot down an American warplane in 1969, during the Nixon administration, killing all 31 crew members of a spy plane that was flying off its coast.
"The whole world should clearly remember it was the U.S. who first declared war on our country," Mr. Ri told reporters at a news conference outside his hotel as he was about to return home.
