AFP/Getty Images On Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford informed the military that the Pentagon would not implement a ban on transgender troops "until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance."
About 15,000 transgender troops are currently serving openly in the United States military.
Until that point, Dunford wrote, there "will be no modifications to the current policy," and "we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect."
