Thank you -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 The move, which ironically comes in the middle of the White House's American Heroes Week, was wholly unexpected.
Trump claims he made the move after consulting with military experts, despite the Pentagon lifting the ban on transgender service members in 2016 after an exhaustive review of its military readiness policies.
