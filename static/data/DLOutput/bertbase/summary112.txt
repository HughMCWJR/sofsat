"This is the last, best chance we will have to cut taxes," said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Budget Committee, who warned that the consequences would be ruinous if the party failed.
"That will be the end of us as a party," he said, "because if you're a Republican and you don't want to simplify the tax code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody?"
Mr. Trump took to Twitter shortly after 1 a.m. to congratulate the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell -- whose tensions with the president have been well-documented -- for a "first step toward delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for the American people!"
