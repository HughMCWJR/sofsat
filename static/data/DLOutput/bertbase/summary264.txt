On Aug. 15, Mr. Cohn stood nearby in the lobby of Trump Tower, where the president told reporters there also were "very fine people on both sides" of the Charlottesville rally.
He is one of the few Jewish members in the administration who have publicly condemned Mr. Trump's remarks about Charlottesville, although he has quietly disagreed with the president on a number of policy matters.
He debated for over a week with his wife and friends on whether to quit, according to the people familiar with his thinking.
