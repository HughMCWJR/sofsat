It's the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president's clemency power to get hundreds of people -- most of them nonviolent drug offenders -- out of prison sooner.
And it tops off another presidential record: With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency, Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman (excluding Gerald Ford's clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers).
Depending on how you look at it, Obama's effort in the twilight of his presidency is either a historic act of criminal justice reform -- or too little too late.
