Video "Lewd" was apparently not a strong enough word for the editors of The Washington Post when they tried to describe the contents of a recording they had acquired, in which Donald J. Trump is heard in a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush, the Access Hollywood host; they went with "extremely lewd" in their headline.
The staff members of New York magazine got a lot closer with a tweet containing a link to the tape: "Extremely disturbing," they called it.
But "lewd," extremely or not, fails to capture the full essence of that recording.
