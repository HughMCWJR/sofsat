The top nuclear commander in the U.S. said Saturday that he would reject an "illegal" nuclear attack order from President Donald Trump, and would instead steer the commander in chief to other "options."
"If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail," Air Force Gen. John Hyten told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia.
"You could go to jail for the rest of your life."
