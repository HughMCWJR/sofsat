WASHINGTON -- Congress delivered a powerful rebuke to President Barack Obama on Wednesday by overriding his veto of a bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged ties to the terrorist attacks.
It's the first time one of Obama's vetoes has been overruled.
Wednesday's vote brings an end to a monthslong scuffle between the White House and Congress over the measure known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.
