Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson -- he had cracked the child's skull -- should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.
The Air Force also said it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported to the federal database for firearms background checks.
Law enforcement officials said Mr. Kelley may have been driven by anger toward his estranged wife's family, the final chapter in a life full of domestic rage.
