The Justice Department's filing sought to have the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit block the Seattle judge's decision and asked that the lower court's ruling be stayed pending the appeal.
In a Twitter post on Saturday, Mr. Trump wrote, "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"
Video In its argument for an appeal, the Justice Department had said the president had an "unreviewable authority" to suspend the entry of any class of foreigners.
