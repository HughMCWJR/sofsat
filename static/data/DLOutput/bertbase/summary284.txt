Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) moved to hold a series of "pro-forma" sessions while senators are away for the month of August.
The Senate unanimously approved a procedure that will block Trump from making recess appointments during August.
The move is the one of the first significant actions Republican Senators have taken to restrain Trump's power.
