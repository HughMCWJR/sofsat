Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, the highest-ranking health official in the Trump administration, is stepping down after harsh criticism of a string of ethics scandals dating back to before his confirmation.
The scandal that sank Price was a series of Politico reports about his use of private jets, taking charter flights that cost tens of thousands of dollars instead of commercial flights that would cost hundreds, as was usual for his predecessors.
The private flights doomed Price, who quickly lost favor with President Donald Trump.
