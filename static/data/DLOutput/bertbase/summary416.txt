After a firestorm of criticism on both the left and right for her secret meeting with former President Bill Clinton during an ongoing Justice Department investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, Attorney General Loretta Lynch will announce Friday that she'll step back and let non-political subordinates decide whether to bring charges against the former secretary of state.
She will accept their decision.
"Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren," Lynch told reporters in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon.
