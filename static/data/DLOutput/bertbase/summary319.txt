On Wednesday, the White House released a statement saying that Trump had "signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission," tasking the Department of Homeland Security "to review these issues and determine next courses of action."
President Donald Trump has terminated his long-troubled voter fraud commission.
In June, the commission sent requests to states asking for all voters' names, party IDs, addresses, and even the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, among other information.
