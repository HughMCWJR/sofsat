Shortly after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) flew back to Washington, DC, on Tuesday and voted to advance Republicans' plan to repeal Obamacare.
Then he gave a speech from the Senate floor in which he criticized the Senate for not following "regular order," urged senators to consider themselves the equals of the president, and said he wouldn't vote for the health care bill as it stands now.
McCain was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer.
