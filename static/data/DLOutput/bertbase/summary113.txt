Davis International Baccalaureate (IB) Elementary School in Jackson will be renamed in honor of Barack Obama at the start of the 2018-19 school year.
School stakeholders voted on Oct. 5 to approve the name change, PTA President Janelle Jefferson announced at a Tuesday evening meeting of the district's board of trustees.
More than 95% of the school's students are black.
