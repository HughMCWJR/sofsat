Mandatory evacuations have been announced in some Houston neighborhoods, as over 30 inches of rain have fallen in some areas.
Tropical Storm Harvey, which made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm, sent devastating floods pouring into Houston on Sunday.
Though the mayor of Houston has come in for criticism for not issuing evacuation orders earlier, officials have pointed out the difficulty of evacuating an area of seven million people facing a disaster that's grown over a period of days.
