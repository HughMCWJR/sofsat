A little before noon on Friday, the White House confirmed that Steve Bannon, the embattled "economic nationalist" whose mastery of Breitbart News helped get Donald Trump elected--thus planting the seed of his own demise--had tendered his resignation.
"Bannon especially dislikes Gary Cohn and Dina Powell, so you can look for a lot of interesting articles about the two of them," Cernovich promised.
Would Trump moderate himself in the absence of the self-proclaimed "alt-right" architect, or had he always had such an appreciation for Confederate monuments and affinity for the white nationalists who have rallied around them?
