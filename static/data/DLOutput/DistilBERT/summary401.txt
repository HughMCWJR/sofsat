In a conversation on Wednesday with NBC's Matt Lauer, Mr. Lochte -- who has already returned to the United States -- changed certain details of his account.
Mr. Lochte had also previously said that the swimmers had been robbed after the men identifying themselves as police officers pulled over their taxi.
On Wednesday, however, he told NBC that the taxi had stopped at a gas station so they could use the bathroom.
