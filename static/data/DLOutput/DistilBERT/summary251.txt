House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats on Thursday increased the pressure on Rep. John Conyers, who is facing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and a House Ethics Committee probe, by calling on him to resign from office.
"Congressman Conyers should resign," Pelosi told reporters on Thursday.
Pelosi's comments are a stark turnaround from her stance on Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" when she praised the Michigan Democrat as an "icon," questioned who his accusers are, and said the ethics probe should be allowed to go forward.
