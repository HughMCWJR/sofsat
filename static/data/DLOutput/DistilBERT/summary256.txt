The deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the Trump administration on Sunday to block the president's appointment of Mick Mulvaney as interim director of the agency.
"We think the clear legal authority is that the president does have this authority," an administration official said in a call with reporters on Saturday.
The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion on Saturday supporting Mulvaney's appointment.
