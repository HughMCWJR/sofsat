A Democratic lawmaker introduced a piece of legislation titled the "Stable Genius Act" that would require aspiring U.S. presidents to undergo a mental-health examination and release medical records prior to elections.
Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania introduced the bill in the House Tuesday amid ongoing controversy over President Donald Trump's mental stability.
The bill would require all presidential candidates to file a report with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), "certifying that he or she has undergone medical examination by the medical office under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Navy," according to CBS News.
