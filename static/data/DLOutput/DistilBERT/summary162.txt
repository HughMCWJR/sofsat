On Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced that she would be essentially gutting Obama-era Title IX sexual assault protections.
Implemented in 2011 during President Obama's term, the protections and guidelines were lauded by advocates and sexual assault survivors as a step forward.
In her announcement, DeVos said that the 2011 Title IX guidelines were insufficient and overreaching, and contributed to a "failed system."
