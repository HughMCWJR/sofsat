Roger Ailes, who spent decades advising political candidates and presidents about the power of television in American life before building Fox News into a media juggernaut -- and who left that network last summer following multiple allegations that he pressured female subordinates to have sexual relationships with him -- has died.
Elizabeth Ailes, his wife, said in a statement Thursday that she was "profoundly sad and heartbroken."
