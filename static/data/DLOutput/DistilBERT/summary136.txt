The Adventure of the Seas ship will be sent to Puerto Rico to deliver supplies to the Caribbean island.
It will also usher evacuees to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., before making another trip to the island next week, according to CNN Money.
The passenger vessel holds 3,800 people and will bring aid to San Juan, along with St. Croix and St. Thomas -- both victims of Maria and Irma.
