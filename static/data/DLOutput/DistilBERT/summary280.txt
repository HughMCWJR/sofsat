Tom Cotton and David Perdue, President Trump unveiled the RAISE Act on Wednesday, an immigration bill that aims to drastically limit legal immigration.
Soon after the press conference, the Anne Frank Center slammed Trump's RAISE Act in a fierce statement likening it to an "ethnic purity test that harkens [sic] to the darkest chapters of world history."
The RAISE Act would bring about sweeping change to American immigration policy.
