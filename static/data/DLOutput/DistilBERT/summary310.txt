But if the impulsive incompetency continues, then eventually--many, many months from now--Republicans will join the impeachment effort.
First, I have slight hope it will inspire an "intervention" in the White House.
If Impeachment is real, if they actually see Articles, perhaps we will see incompetency replaced by care.
