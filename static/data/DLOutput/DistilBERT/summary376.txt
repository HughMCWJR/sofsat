Hillary Clinton spoke publicly for the first time since privately conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump, addressing the nation just before noon Wednesday from the Wyndham New Yorker hotel in Midtown Manhattan.
Clinton was accompanied Wednesday morning by her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and surrounded by dozens of her campaign staffers, some in tears.
"This is painful, and it will be for a long time," Clinton said.
