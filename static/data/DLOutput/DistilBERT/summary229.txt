The Senate early Wednesday passed the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax-cut plan, putting it closer to President Trump's desk with an additional House vote expected Wednesday.
Senate Democrats managed to strike several provisions from a House-passed bill on procedural grounds, but Republicans nevertheless expect to send a final measure to Mr. Trump shortly to fulfill his top legislative priority and complete the most significant rewrite of the tax code in three decades.
The Senate passed the slightly modified plan on a 51-48 vote after the House passed its bill earlier in the day on a 227-203 vote.
