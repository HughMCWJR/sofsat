The Obama administration released data Monday showing that premiums for midlevel plans will rise, on average, 22 percent between 2016 and 2017.
Most Obamacare enrollees (83 percent) receive subsidies that limit the amount they have to spend on premiums.
Obamacare premiums are on track to rise faster than ever before in 2017.
