Donald Trump's comments about the NFL are starting to make Rush Limbaugh feel nervous, the conservative radio host said on his show Wednesday.
Limbaugh, who has previously expressed his concern about Trump's tweets, made his feelings on the president's interference in the ongoing NFL protests clear on his show.
Limbaugh's comments came after Trump tweeted on Wednesday suggesting NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was demanding players stand for the national anthem, following a number of players taking a knee to protest police brutality against African Americans.
