The Congressional Budget Office's report now confirms it: Medicaid, a health service for poorer Americans, as well as the disabled and elderly, would see a $772 billion cut over the next 10 years.
It's hard to miss the fundamental design of the Senate's health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare: a bill that makes deep cuts to services for low-income Americans to pay for tax cuts that would largely benefit the country's wealthiest.
This is in reference to the part of the health care bill that looks to phase out Medicaid expansion in 2021 and restructure funding for the program that would ultimately result in less funding to states for Medicaid.
