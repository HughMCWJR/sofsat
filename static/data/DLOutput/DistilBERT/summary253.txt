On Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing "sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused."
Even President Trump -- who himself has denied multiple allegations of sexual misconduct -- weighed in, seizing on Mr. Lauer's firing to denounce NBC News's coverage and call for other senior figures at NBC News to be ousted.
Mr. Lauer, 59, joins an ignominious group of media figures felled by the recent spate of harassment claims, including the studio mogul Harvey Weinstein, the comedian Louis C.K., the CBS host Charlie Rose and the political journalist Mark Halperin.
