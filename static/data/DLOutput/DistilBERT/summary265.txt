White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has not briefed the media since Corker made his remarks.
He added, "[Trump] also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation."
"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful," Corker said.
