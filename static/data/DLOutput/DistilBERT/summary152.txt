President Trump arrives Monday at his first United Nations General Assembly on a mission to cultivate friendships and call out enemies, officials said, with a plan to aggressively put his "America First" agenda into action on the world stage.
"The world is still trying to take the measure of this president.
"We can all say it is a new day at the U.N.," said Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
