"The president understands he has to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution," Mr. Ryan said.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, issued a curt statement saying he and his colleagues "look forward to receiving the Trump administration's legislative proposal," while Mr. Ryan called Wednesday night's talks "a discussion, not an agreement or a negotiation."
"I think President Trump has a chance to be on immigration what President Nixon was on China; he has a lot of credibility on the issue," said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee.
