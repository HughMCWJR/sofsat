Bergdahl pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, after walking off his base in Afghanistan in 2009.
Bowe Bergdahl was dishonorably discharged from the Army, but but would not serve any prison time, a military judge ruled Friday.
President Donald Trump, who advocated for Bergdahl's execution during the campaign, was not happy with the sentence.
