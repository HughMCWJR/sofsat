Mr. Trump and General McMaster have been something of an odd couple since the president tapped him in February after pushing out Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, for not being forthright about a conversation with Russia's ambassador.
That does not mean General McMaster's job is secure in the long run, but White House officials said no one should expect him to leave anytime soon, especially now that his position has been fortified by the arrival of John F. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who took over as chief of staff.
General McMaster is a serious, somber briefer who prefers an orderly process and does not respond particularly well to Mr. Trump's looser style.
