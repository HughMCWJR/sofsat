The 8.1-magnitude quake triggered hundreds of aftershocks and a small tsunami near Salina Cruz in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
Mexico's most powerful earthquake in more than eight decades hit off the country's southern coast late Thursday evening, damaging and destroying hundreds of buildings and killing at least 34 people.
About 50 million people felt the tremor -- including those living in Mexico City, hundreds of miles from the quake's epicenter -- and nearly 2 million people lost power, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said.
