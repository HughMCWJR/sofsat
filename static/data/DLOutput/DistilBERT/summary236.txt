The House and Senate will convene Wednesday, swearing in the newly elected Democratic senator from Alabama, Doug Jones, and Minnesota's Tina Smith to replace a fellow Democrat, Sen. Al Franken, who is resigning as the latest high-profile public figure sidelined by allegations of sexual misconduct.

Secretary of State John Merrill said it's too soon to know whether the margin of victory by Doug Jones in Alabama's special election on Tuesday will trigger the state's automatic recount law.
