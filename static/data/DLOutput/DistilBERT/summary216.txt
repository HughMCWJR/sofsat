WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal and longtime opponent of marijuana, will allow the nation's top federal prosecutors to decide how to handle marijuana cases in states where the drug has been legalized.
One Justice Department official called Sessions's decision a "return to the rule of law."
"Marijuana continues to be against federal law," one said.
