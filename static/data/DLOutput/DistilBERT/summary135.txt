While residents of Puerto Rico struggle to get access to basic necessities like potable water and food, President Donald Trump has launched a full-fledged attack on the news media and, even more concerning, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz.
Cruz, the mayor of Puerto Rico's largest city, made several emotional pleas this week to the media, tearfully begging for the government to provide more aid to the islands residents and for private citizens to make calls to Congress or to donate money or time.
Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump."
