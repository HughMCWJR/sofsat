President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his push for his executive order banning travel and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries, lashing out against his own Justice Department and potentially exacerbating the continued legal battle over the order.
A federal court in Virginia pointed to Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric when it ruled against the executive order last month.
