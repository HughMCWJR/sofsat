Steve Bannon will appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, supposedly to answer questions about his role in Trump's campaign and any connection to Russian operatives.
On the other hand, Democrats are likely to ask Bannon about this: Fallen former President Trump confidante Steve Bannon was served immediate subpoenas during his closed-door meeting with lawmakers Tuesday to provide testimony on information the White House instructed him not to share, according to sources with knowledge of the conversations.
This comes after Bannon first described the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump's top campaign staff and a group of Russian representatives as both "treasonous" and "unpatriotic"--and then went on to explain how to do secret meetings with the Russians correctly.
