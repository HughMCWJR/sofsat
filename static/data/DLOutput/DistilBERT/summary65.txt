Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that the federal judge who halted President Trump's temporary immigration ban "made the wrong decision" and vowed to use "all legal means at our disposal" to protect Americans.
"We are going to win this argument."
Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and the United States' Syrian refugee program.
