Rep. Al Green (D-TX) became the first member of Congress to officially read articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the floor on Wednesday -- and the president's Twitter account is at the center of Trump's alleged "crimes and misdemeanors."
He told Vox he wanted to give members of Congress and the public "an opportunity to read them" before a vote.
In a 15-page document, which was provided to Vox and can be read in full below, Green says the president should be impeached for tweeting "disparaging" remarks about NFL players, Puerto Ricans, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and President Barack Obama.
