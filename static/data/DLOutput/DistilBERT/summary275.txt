Given one more chance to forcefully condemn the neo-Nazis and white supremacists whose rally in Charlottesville, Va., ended in violence and a counterprotester's death, Mr. Trump angrily insisted, as he had suggested on Saturday, that both sides were equally to blame -- a false equivalency that not just his critics but also an increasing number of his supporters have urged him to abandon.
The setting was a bizarre and contentious press conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan that was originally meant to be about infrastructure but quickly escalated into a shouting match about Charlottesville.
In its place was a high-decibel defense of his original position, to which he added the claim that while there were "bad people" and "very fine people" on both sides, the "very, very violent" protesters on the "alt-left" who came "charging in without a permit" were at least as culpable as the neo-Nazi protesters.
