Mr. Trump, through Twitter, is giving the world access in real time to his unvarnished thoughts, which Mr. Neal called "raw, unsophisticated, ignorant and uninformed."
Mr. Trump has also not made any public announcement of plans to commemorate Martin Luther King's Birthday, a tradition observed by most Republican and Democratic politicians.
Mr. Trump's talk is especially striking as it comes during the transition period, when, typically, incoming presidents are focused on trying to bring the country together.
