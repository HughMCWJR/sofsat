The U.S. State Department admitted today to deleting video from an archived press briefing which included statements it made about controversial American diplomatic talks with Iran.
Today, spokesman John Kirby admitted the edit was made deliberately, directed by unknown persons, and executed by a staffer in the technical department.
The portion of the 2013 daily press briefing in question included a discussion about the U.S. diplomatic negotiations with Iran.
