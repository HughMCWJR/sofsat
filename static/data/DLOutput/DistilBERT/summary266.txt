President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), intensifying a feud with his own party's congressional leaders.
In a pair of tweets targeting "Mitch M" and "Paul R," Trump accused them of creating "a mess" in the challenge Congress faces to raise the federal debt ceiling when lawmakers return from recess in September.
But hard-core conservative Republicans in Congress could block raising the ceiling by insisting such legislation include big cuts in federal spending.
