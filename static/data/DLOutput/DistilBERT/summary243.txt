Photo President Trump announced on Wednesday that his administration is making a radical break with nearly 70 years of official United States policy and with the international community: He is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
It will cause irreparable harm to Mr. Trump's own plans to make peace in the Middle East, and to any future administration's efforts, as well.
The president should reconsider this decision immediately.
