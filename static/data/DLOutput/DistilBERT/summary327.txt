The case, Peruta v. California, No.
16-894, concerned a state law that essentially bans carrying guns openly in public and allows carrying concealed weapons only if applicants can demonstrate good cause.
The court did not decide whether the Second Amendment allows leeway for states to ban carrying guns in public.
