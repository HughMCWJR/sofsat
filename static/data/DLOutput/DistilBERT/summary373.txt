Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who once called Mr. Trump a "faker" who "has no consistency about him," said on Monday what she likely wanted to avoid: Mr. Trump will make the Supreme Court whole again.
She urged the Senate to act promptly on the president-elect's nomination to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.
While Mr. Trump said he hoped to have a constructive relationship with Russia, he insisted during one of his debates with Hillary Clinton that he was "no puppet" of Mr. Putin.
