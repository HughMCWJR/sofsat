Video President Trump's remarks on Friday that he would not rule out a "military option" to quell the chaos in Venezuela set off a late-night diplomatic duel, with the defense minister accusing Mr. Trump of "an act of madness" and the White House saying it had turned away a call from Venezuela's president.
"It is an act of supreme extremism," Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said late Friday in Caracas, the capital.
"President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country."
