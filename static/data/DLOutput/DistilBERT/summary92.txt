Former President Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden called for action to prevent gun violence in the hours after the shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Sunday that left 26 people dead and at least 20 injured.
The shooting comes just over a month after the mass shooting in Las Vegas which left 58 people dead -- the deadliest such incident in U.S. history.
"May God also grant all of us the wisdom to ask what concrete steps we can take to reduce the violence and weaponry in our midst," he said.
