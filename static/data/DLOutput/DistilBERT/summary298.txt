x Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
Once again, Donald Trump is using his morning Twitter fit as a way to attack, not just Hillary Clinton, but the attorney general he put in office.
The top White House spokesperson warned Tuesday that President Trump's frustration with Jeff Sessions is not going away, moments after the president tore into his attorney general on Twitter as "VERY weak" on Hillary Clinton's supposed "crimes."
