Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson -- he had cracked the child's skull -- should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.
-- A day after a gunman massacred parishioners in a small Texas church, the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to enter the man's domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the rifle he used to kill 26 people.
In addition to his court-martial, in which his previous wife was the victim, he had been investigated on a rape complaint, though he was not charged and his relationship to the woman in the complaint was unclear.
