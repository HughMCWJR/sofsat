Thousands of Californians will have their misdemeanor pot convictions expunged automatically and thousands more may have felony cases re-categorized, after San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon announced plans to make the state's pot legalization law apply retroactively on Wednesday.
The San Francisco review will stretch back more than 40 years.
Roughly 5,000 Californians have filed a court petition to have their pot records cleared since Prop 64 took effect, according to figures from the non-profit Drug Policy Alliance.
