- ABC News Network Congressional lawmakers begin returning to Washington on Monday after a tense week-long recess in which Republicans got an earful about ObamaCare and other issues and ahead of President Trump's first speech to a joint session of Congress.
With the GOP controlling both chambers of Congress and now the White House, Republican lawmakers' first trip home this session could have been a victory lap.
Treasure Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday told Fox News that the speech will include Trump's plan for corporate and individual tax reform.
