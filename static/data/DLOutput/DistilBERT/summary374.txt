Protesters across the US were on Friday gearing up for weekend demonstrations over the election of Donald Trump, as other activists began work on plans to disrupt the Republican's inauguration in Washington early next year.
A "million women" march on the capital is being planned for the day of Trump's inauguration, amid intense anger that the next US president allegedly sexually assaulted multiple women and boasted of doing so in a leaked recording.
More than 10,000 people have signed up to attend a noon march on Saturday from New York's Union Square to Trump Tower, the future president's home and corporate headquarters, while several other actions are planned for other cities.
