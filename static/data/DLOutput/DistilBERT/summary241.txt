CNN is reporting that the Trump campaign--including candidate Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and others--were offered access to Wikileaks documents, including special access to a Wikileaks website, a month before Wikileaks began publishing documents stolen from John Podesta's account to the public.
The email, which apparently slipped the memory of history's most forgetful campaign team, included a decryption key and address for documents stolen by Russian hackers and later distributed through Wikileaks.
The email came less than three weeks before WikiLeaks itself messaged Trump Jr. and began an exchange of direct messages on Twitter.
