The unspoken mission statement of the NRA is to sell as many firearms as possible.
The only legitimate reason it exists in 2016 is to provide a disproportionately sacrosanct, nearly biblical cover for the corporate, for-profit gun manufacturing industry.
Honestly, it's difficult to grasp why firearms need to be an intrinsic part of our Constitution and therefore untouchable as the sole product named in the Bill of Rights.
