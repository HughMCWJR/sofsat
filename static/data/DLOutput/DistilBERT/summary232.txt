Kory Langhofer, the attorney for the Trump for America transition team, sent a seven-page letter to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Oversight Committee, claiming that employees of the GSA "unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel's office."
GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt also contradicted the claims made by Trump's transition team.
A source tells Axios that the transition team will be sending a letter to Mueller asking for some emails to be returned because they're privileged.
