DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act -- an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island -- on Sept. 28.
WASHINGTON -- The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and "it is not being extended at this time," Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.
The waiver had meant that Puerto Rico had the option of importing food, fuel and supplies more quickly, and for half the cost, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
