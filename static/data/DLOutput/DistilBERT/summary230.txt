Alabama is the latest state to bear bad news to recipients of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), warning families Monday that it will no longer enroll children starting Jan. 1, 2018 and will terminate the program entirely on Feb. 1, 2018 if Congress fails to act.
CHIP provides low-cost health coverage to nearly nine million children nationwide, and provides insurance to roughly 150,000 Alabama children, 84,000 of which are at risk of losing coverage through the state's CHIP, dubbed ALL Kids.
Congressional lawmakers have yet to renew federal funding for CHIP since the program expired on Sept. 30.
