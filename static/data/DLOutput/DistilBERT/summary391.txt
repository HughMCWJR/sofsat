By contrast, the Police Department in Charlotte, N.C., has responded in exactly the wrong way to a police officer's killing on Tuesday of another black man, Keith Scott.
On Thursday, the Tulsa County district attorney charged that officer with first-degree manslaughter for Mr. Crutcher's death.
It has opted for stonewalling.
