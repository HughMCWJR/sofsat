The Justice Department's decision to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel charged with investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is a win for Democrats, a new blow to a reeling White House, and a clear sign that the scandal that has engulfed the administration will only accelerate in the weeks and months ahead.
It was also the person put into the job: Mueller, who spent his career in the FBI and who takes the post just weeks after Trump startled lawmakers and officials from both parties by abruptly firing FBI Director James Comey (who is also, incidentally, Mueller's close friend).
That's why the announcement by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein came as a surprise to so many people -- including the White House, which was reportedly given just 30 minutes' warning before the announcement went public.
