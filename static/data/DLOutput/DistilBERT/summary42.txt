Authorities in Britain said Masood, the London suspect, had recently been living in the West Midlands in central England, was known by several aliases and had previously been investigated by the MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence agency.
The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the terror attack that left four people dead, including the assailant and a police officer, outside of London's Parliament building on Wednesday, according to the Amaq media agency.
He had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offenses dating from November 1983 to December 2003, police said.
