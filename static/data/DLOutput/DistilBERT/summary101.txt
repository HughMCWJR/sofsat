The Trump adviser in question is George Papadopoulos -- a foreign policy adviser to the campaign who, it was revealed in a document unsealed Monday, had been arrested back in July for making false statements to the FBI, and now appears to have made a deal to cooperate with Mueller's probe into Russian interference.
That is: A low-level Trump adviser was told as early as April 2016 that the Russians had "dirt" on Hillary Clinton, in the form of "thousands of emails."
Questions about Trump, Russia, and the 2016 campaign are often framed in terms of whether there was "collusion."
