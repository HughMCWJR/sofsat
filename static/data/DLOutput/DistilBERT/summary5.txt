Leaked NSA documents revealing that Russia engaged in election-related hacking efforts just days before the election directly contradict what former President Barack Obama told the American public.
Russia's cyberattacks stopped after warnings of "serious consequences" if they continued, Obama said.
But NSA documents published by The Intercept on Monday revealed that as late as October 31 or November 1, hackers launched an election-related spearfishing operation "targeting U.S. local government organizations."
