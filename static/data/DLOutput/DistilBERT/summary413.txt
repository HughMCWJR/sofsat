Clinton campaign officials, in another bid to placate the party's left wing, picked Senator Elizabeth Warren to deliver the keynote address on Monday night, hoping that her searing denunciations of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, would unify the delegates in the hall.
"Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her here tonight," Mr. Sanders said as his supporters waved his blue campaign signs.
But he said the choice between his onetime rival and Mr. Trump was "not even close."
