On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will deliver an address to a joint session of Congress in Washington, the biggest speech he's given since his inaugural address back on Jan. 20.
In almost every way, the speech Mr. Trump will give is identical to the State of the Union, the annual, wide-ranging speech a sitting president delivers before Congress early in the year.
Other recent presidents have delivered joint addresses to Congress on a similar timeline.
