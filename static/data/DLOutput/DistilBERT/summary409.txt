HOUSTON -- The Green Party officially nominated Massachusetts physician and progressive activist Jill Stein as its presidential candidate on Saturday, also selecting human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.
"We are what democracy looks like and we are what political revolution looks like," Stein said accepting her party's nomination.
However, the party has already been excluded from the ballot in Indiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma.
