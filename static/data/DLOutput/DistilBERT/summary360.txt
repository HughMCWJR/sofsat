Mr. Trump, according to a person briefed on the decision, has not yet formally offered the job to General Kelly, who is out of the country.
The president-elect plans to roll out the appointment next week, along with his remaining national security choices, including secretary of state.
General Kelly would be the third retired general to get a senior position in Mr. Trump's cabinet, reflecting the president-elect's comfort with military men in important national security posts.
