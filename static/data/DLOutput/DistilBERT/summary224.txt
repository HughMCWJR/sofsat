The 9th Circuit, limiting an injunction against the ban by a Honolulu-based federal judge, said it should not be enforced against those who have a "bona fide relationship" to a person or entity in the United States.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday that part of President Trump's third attempt at a travel ban should be blocked.
The ruling, however, will not take effect pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
