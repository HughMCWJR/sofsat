On Tuesday, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Kenosha Unified School District in Wisconsin violated the rights of a trans student, Ash Whitaker, when it refused to let him use the boys' bathroom.
According to the court, Whitaker is likely to win upon a full review of the case (instead of the current review of a lower court's preliminary injunction) on his claim that the school's actions violated Title IX, a federal law that prohibits discrimination in schools based on sex, and the Equal Protections Clause of the 14th Amendment.
A single student's case has turned into a massive legal decision for all transgender Americans.
