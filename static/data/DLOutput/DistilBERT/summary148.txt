Senate Republicans are once again just a few votes away from repealing and replacing Obamacare.
The underlying truth, the beating heart of Obamacare repeal that refuses to let it die, is: Republicans just want to pass a bill, any bill, to say they repealed Obamacare.
Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA), keeps most of Obamacare's taxes (once a deal breaker for many Republicans), turns the revenue into a block grant, and sends the money down to the states with very few strings attached.
