Tweeden's post includes the photo, which shows Franken smiling and touching her breasts while posing for the camera.
When Tweeden returned to the US, she said she was looking through a CD of photos provided by a photographer on the trip and found one of the now-senator groping her while she was asleep.
Morning news anchor Leeann Tweeden first accused Franken of misconduct last week, dating back to 2006 when he was a comedian headed to entertain US troops overseas along with other celebrities.
