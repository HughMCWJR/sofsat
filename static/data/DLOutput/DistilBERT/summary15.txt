JERUSALEM -- President Trump began a two-day visit to Israel on Monday with a blunt assessment for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: If Israel really wants peace with its Arab neighbors, the cost will be resolving the generations-old standoff with the Palestinians.
President Trump, during high-stakes meetings in Jerusalem, said Monday that a shared international concern over Iran is driving Israel and Arab states in the region closer while further alienating Tehran from the global community.
"On those issues, there is a strong consensus among the nations of the world -- including many in the Muslim world," Mr. Trump said.
