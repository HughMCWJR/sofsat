The U.S. State Department released the funds to the Palestinian Authority, the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas that presides over the West Bank.
Barack Obama's administration handed the Palestinians $221 million (PS177 million) on his last day in office, officials say.
The money, drawn from the U.S. Agency for International Development, is intended for humanitarian assistance in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
