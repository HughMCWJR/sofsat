President Obama will pay tribute Tuesday afternoon to the five police officers killed in last week's ambush in Dallas.
He will attend and speak at a private, interfaith memorial service, and former President George W. Bush will also deliver remarks.
Dallas Police Chief David Brown said investigators are questioning gunman Micah Johnson's mother, Delphine Johnson, who shared her Dallas-area home with her son.
