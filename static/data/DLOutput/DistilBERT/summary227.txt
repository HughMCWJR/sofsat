In a stinging rebuke of President Donald Trump's controversial decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel earlier this month, 128 countries, including some of the US's most trusted and reliable allies, voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of his position.
Only nine countries voted against it.
The measure declares that any changes to the status of Jerusalem "have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded."
