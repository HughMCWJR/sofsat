North Korea appears "primed and ready" to carry out another nuclear test, satellite images suggest, defying President Donald Trump's warning that American could use military force to stop the pariah nation's atomic ambitions.
Just one day earlier, the North warned it would strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons at any sign of aggression from Washington -- although analysts don't believe the country has the ability to do so yet.
The possibility of a new nuclear test comes as North Korea prepares to celebrate the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung on Sunday, an event that has previously been marked by with missile tests and other shows of force.
