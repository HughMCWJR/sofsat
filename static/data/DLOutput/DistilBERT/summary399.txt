Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's powerful denunciation Thursday of "alt-right" extremism that she said GOP opponent Donald Trump embraces was cheered by adherents of the political philosophy.
Clinton, linking Trump with white nationalists and a "radical fringe," delivered a blistering attack on what she said was the alt-right's takeover of the Republican Party.
"Hillary Clinton is giving a speech about us today."
