President Donald Trump is currently deciding whether or not to release a controversial secret memo, compiled by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), that alleges an anti-Trump conspiracy at the FBI.
Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted on Monday night to release it, though Democrats unanimously opposed it.
The vote gave Trump five days to review the document and decide on its release.
