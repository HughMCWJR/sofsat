A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration's decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined--that is, blocked--Trump's attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.
This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance--or the merits--of the challenge to Trump's plan to terminate DACA.
