Supervisors Vote 10-1 To Rename Columbus Day To Indigenous Peoples' Day SAN FRANCISCO (BCN) San Francisco supervisors today voted 10-1 to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day despite a last-minute effort to delay the vote in response to objections from some members of the city's Italian-American community.
Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who represents the North Beach neighborhood, where the annual parade on Columbus Day has long since been renamed as the Italian Heritage parade, asked the board to postpone a vote on the resolution after receiving a large number of emails from constituents.
"I would like some time to figure out a path forward that works for our indigenous native peoples as well as for folks of Italian heritage," Peskin said.
