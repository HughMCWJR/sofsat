Lowering the cap on 401(k) contributions Lawmakers are still considering changes to the amount of pretax income that workers can set aside in their 401(k) retirement accounts.
Currently, workers under 50 can save up to $18,000 a year without having to pay taxes up front.
House Republicans are discussing changing the rules so workers are encouraged to put more money into retirement accounts that are taxed upfront, like Roth I.R.A.s, rather than on the back end.
