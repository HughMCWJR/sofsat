This comes after Bannon first described the meeting at Trump Tower between Trump's top campaign staff and a group of Russian representatives as both "treasonous" and "unpatriotic"--and then went on to explain how to do secret meetings with the Russians correctly.
Bannon went on, Wolff writes, to say that if any such meeting had to take place, it should have been set up "in a Holiday Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people".
Steve Bannon will appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, supposedly to answer questions about his role in Trump's campaign and any connection to Russian operatives.
