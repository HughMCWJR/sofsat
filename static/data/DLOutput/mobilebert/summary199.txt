The court, where Democrats have a 5-2 majority, blocked the use of the map in the 2018 midterm elections, ordered state lawmakers to begin to draw a new map.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the state's congressional map went so far to benefit Republicans that it "clearly, plainly and palpably" violated the state constitution.
The suit against the congressional map, which only challenged it under Pennsylvania's state constitution, was one of the most watched voting rights cases in the country.
