Special counsel Robert Mueller (2nd L) leaves after a closed meeting with members of the Senate Judiciary Committee June 21, 2017 at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office is not staying silent following explosive accusations by a lawyer for President Donald Trump's transition team that the investigators looking into claims of collusion with Moscow during the campaign unlawfully received tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration.
Kory Langhofer, the attorney for the Trump for America transition team, sent a seven-page letter to the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the House Oversight Committee, claiming that employees of the GSA "unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications, to the special counsel's office."
Langhofer claimed that they were never informed that the documents were handed over and there were potential violations of attorney-client privilege as well as the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unlawful search and seizure.
