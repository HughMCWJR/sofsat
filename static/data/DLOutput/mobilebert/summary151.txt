For anyone who missed the show or hasn't caught wind of the brouhaha since, Spicer came onto the stage behind the kind of podium that Melissa McCarthy used in her impersonations of him and told the Emmys host, Stephen Colbert, "This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period -- both in person and around the world."
His words alluded, obviously, to his fictitious claim -- at his very first news conference as the White House press secretary -- about the crowds for Trump's inauguration.
You're Spicey!
