-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2017 Breaking up is hard to do ... President Trump on Thursday accused Congress of bringing relations with Russia to an "all-time & very dangerous low" after sending him a sanctions bill which he reluctantly signed a day earlier - legislation that prompted a furious response from Russia's prime minister.
You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!
Trump tweeted.
