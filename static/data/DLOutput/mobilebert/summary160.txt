Mexico's most powerful earthquake in more than eight decades hit off the country's southern coast late Thursday evening, damaging and destroying hundreds of buildings and killing at least 34 people.
The 8.1-magnitude quake triggered hundreds of aftershocks and a small tsunami near Salina Cruz in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.
The largest waves were 1 meter high, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported.
