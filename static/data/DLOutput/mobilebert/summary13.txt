British Prime Minister Theresa May has said she will insist that intelligence shared with the United States must remain secure when she meets with President Donald Trump.
In Brussels on Thursday for a NATO summit at which Trump will also be present, May said she would "make clear" to the U.S. president that leaking of sensitive information to the media must cease, the Press Association reported.
Trump has often gone on the attack against "leakers," but that desire to turn off the tap has been uniformly related to people who spill information about his own misstatements, misdeeds, and deceptions.
