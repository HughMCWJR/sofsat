Sean Hannity kicked off his Tuesday night show interviewing Donald Trump Jr. with a scathing attack on the mainstream media, calling members of the press "overpaid, lazy, rigid, left-wing ideologues."
The Fox News host sat down with the president's eldest son, who had tweeted out an email exchange from last year that showed he was connected with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who said she had damaging information obtained by the Russian government about then-presidential rival Hillary Clinton.
Hannity, known for his unwavering support of President Donald Trump, was the first to interview Trump Jr. about the emails and his meeting with the Russian lawyer.
