That's according to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who on Thursday explicitly warned the president against meddling with the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.
"The idea that the president would fire Mueller -- or have somebody fire Mueller -- because he doesn't like Mueller or Mueller is doing something he doesn't like... then we become Russia," Graham said in an interview on Capitol Hill.
"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong."
