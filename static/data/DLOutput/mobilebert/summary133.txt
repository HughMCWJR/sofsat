But we have asked this question dozens of times before.
To awaken Monday morning to the worst mass shooting by a single shooter in American history, after so many natural disasters have plagued American citizens these last few weeks, is to ask, how many more of these man-made disasters do we have to endure before something is done to prevent them?
Just because this is the worst such shooting doesn't mean anything will change -- not a single law, not a single Republican Congressional mind and certainly not a single officer of the NRA.
