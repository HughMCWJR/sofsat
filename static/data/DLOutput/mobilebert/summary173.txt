The president released a statement on Wednesday morning: I want to thank Chairman Grassley for introducing legislation based on the White House Immigration Reform and Border Security Framework.
President Trump is throwing his support behind Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his immigration legislation, as the debate over immigration reform continues to play out on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Trump released a statement, urging the Senate to support Grassley's bill and oppose bills that "fail to deliver for the American people."
