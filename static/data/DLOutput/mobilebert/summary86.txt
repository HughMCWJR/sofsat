-- At the Capitol, establishment Republicans expressed alarm.
"If these allegations are true, he must step aside," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a formal statement on behalf of all Republican senators.
A host of his members made similar comments, including Jeff Flake, David Perdue, John Thune, Cory Gardner and Pat Toomey.
