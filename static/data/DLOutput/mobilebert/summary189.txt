WASHINGTON -- With his Justice Department and FBI facing broad attacks from some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that he'll stand up to any "unfair" attacks on the men and women of the Justice Department he now oversees.
Sessions, in a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, mentioned the "sharp criticisms" of DOJ coming from Congress.
"If anyone falls short of these high standards, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action, and we will do so in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Department," Sessions said.
