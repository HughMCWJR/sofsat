Donald Trump has talked big about the action he was going to take to combat the opioid epidemic, describing it as a "national emergency," which he said he was "saying officially, right now" back in August.
Except he wasn't actually officially declaring a national emergency then or at any of the other times he decided to try to sound serious about opioids.
Instead, he's declaring a public health emergency.
