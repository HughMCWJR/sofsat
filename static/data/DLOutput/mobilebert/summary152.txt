President Trump arrives Monday at his first United Nations General Assembly on a mission to cultivate friendships and call out enemies, officials said, with a plan to aggressively put his "America First" agenda into action on the world stage.
"For a number of leaders, this is going to be their first chance to see him, to judge him, to try to get on his good side.... How that goes off is unclear."
Mr. Trump will be pushing reforms to the U.N. and rethinking America's massive contributions, brokering economic deals around the world and trying to inspire global resolve to confront North Korea, Iran, Islamic State and other threats, top aides say.
