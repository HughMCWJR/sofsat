SUTHERLAND SPRINGS, Tex.
Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson -- he had cracked the child's skull -- should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.
"The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction," the Air Force said in a statement.
