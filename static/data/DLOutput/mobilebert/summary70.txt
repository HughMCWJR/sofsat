The money, drawn from the U.S. Agency for International Development, is intended for humanitarian assistance in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The U.S. State Department released the funds to the Palestinian Authority, the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas that presides over the West Bank.
It is meant to provide assistance for reform in the territories for any future Palestinian state.
