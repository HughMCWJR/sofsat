Michael Cohen, a longtime representative of the Trump Organization, reportedly negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with a lawyer for the woman, Stephanie Clifford, over an encounter that allegedly occurred in 2006.
Clifford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The deal would have been reached around the same time a leaked recording revealed the now-infamous lewd comments Trump made on the set of "Access Hollywood" in 2005.
