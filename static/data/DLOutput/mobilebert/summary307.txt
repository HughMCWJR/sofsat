John McCain is out of McConnell's clutches for a week or two.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has to have every Republican senator voting to have a prayer of passing Trumpcare, has postponed the vote for the week or two (more likely two) that McCain's recovery will take.
While Sen. John McCain remains in Arizona recovering from Friday's craniotomy, surgery to remove a 5 cm blood clot from above his left eye, business will not go on as usual in Washington.
