Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in Moscow meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov amid mounting tensions between the U.S. and Russia over the war in Syria.
While the U.S. asserts the Syrian government carried out the attack, Russia has blamed it on the anti-government rebels.
On Tuesday, White House officials accused Russia of trying to cover up the Syrian government's alleged role in last week's chemical attack, which killed 86 civilians, including dozens of children.
