Senate Democrats managed to strike several provisions from a House-passed bill on procedural grounds, but Republicans nevertheless expect to send a final measure to Mr. Trump shortly to fulfill his top legislative priority and complete the most significant rewrite of the tax code in three decades.
The Senate early Wednesday passed the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax-cut plan, putting it closer to President Trump's desk with an additional House vote expected Wednesday.
"Many of us in this body have been waiting years for this opportunity, and millions of Americans outside of this body have been waiting even longer," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
