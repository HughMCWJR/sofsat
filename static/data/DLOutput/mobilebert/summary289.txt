President Trump portrayed a very dark picture of America during a speech on Friday that returned to one of his favorite themes from the campaign: Immigrants are bringing drugs, crime, and violence to the US and must be stopped.
Amid a recent uptick in gang violence in suburban Long Island, Trump portrayed the fight as an all-out war between US officials and the MS-13 gang.
He called gang members "animals" and repeatedly said police are "liberating" multiple towns and cities across the United States.
