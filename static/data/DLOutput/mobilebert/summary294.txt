Three Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- voted to block the Senate's so-called "skinny" repeal bill.
The result is, for now, a crushing blow to seven years of promises to uproot the health care law.
It was the bare minimum: The bill failed on a procedural vote, 49 to 51.
