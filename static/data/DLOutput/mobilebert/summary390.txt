WASHINGTON -- Congress delivered a powerful rebuke to President Barack Obama on Wednesday by overriding his veto of a bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged ties to the terrorist attacks.
It's the first time one of Obama's vetoes has been overruled.
It takes a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to override a presidential veto, which is why it's so rare.
