WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton's first speech since she won a majority of pledged delegates in the Democratic presidential race included remarks about how abortion relates to other issues.
The term "reproductive justice" was promoted by the grassroots women of color collective SisterSong over a decade ago to describe "the complete physical, mental, spiritual, political, social, and economic well-being" of a person.
That's groundbreaking for a presidential candidate.
