Clinton was accompanied Wednesday morning by her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and surrounded by dozens of her campaign staffers, some in tears.
Her supporters gave her a rousing standing ovation when she entered the room.
She smiled and declared, "I love you, too," to those who cheered her.
