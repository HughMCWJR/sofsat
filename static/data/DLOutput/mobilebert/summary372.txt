Photograph: Carlo Allegri/Reuters Donald Trump's transition to the White House appeared to be in disarray on Tuesday after the abrupt departure of a top national security adviser and amid continuing questions over the role of his three children and son-in-law.
Former Republican congressman Mike Rogers stepped down from the president-elect's transition team without explanation, but one report attributed it to a "Stalinesque purge".
Late on Tuesday, Trump attempted to paint a less chaotic picture, tweeting that the transition process was "very organized".
