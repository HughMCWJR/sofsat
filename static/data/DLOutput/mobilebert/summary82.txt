This story was updated on November 13 at 10:28 pm Just before the stroke of midnight on September 20, 2016, at the height of last year's presidential election, the WikiLeaks Twitter account sent a private direct message to Donald Trump Jr., the Republican nominee's oldest son and campaign surrogate.
The transparency organization asked the president's son for his cooperation--in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the election, and in arranging for Julian Assange to be Australia's ambassador to the United States.
"A PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch," WikiLeaks wrote.
