It is exceedingly rare for the country's biggest news organizations to publish a quote that includes an expletive; usually, they employ a censored or blanked-out version.
On Thursday's network evening newscasts, NBC News was the only organization that quoted Mr. Trump in full.
Anchors at ABC and CBS used the word "blank" instead.
