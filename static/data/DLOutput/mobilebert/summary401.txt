In a conversation on Wednesday with NBC's Matt Lauer, Mr. Lochte -- who has already returned to the United States -- changed certain details of his account.
After previously saying that an assailant had put a gun against his forehead, he said that the gun had been aimed in his "general direction."
On Wednesday, however, he told NBC that the taxi had stopped at a gas station so they could use the bathroom.
