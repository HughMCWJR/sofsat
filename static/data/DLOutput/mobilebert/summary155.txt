Mr. Trump's comments, at a time when Republicans had hoped to focus on rewriting the tax code, came amid a chaotic day of back and forth on Capitol Hill over what, precisely, had emerged from Wednesday's White House dinner -- and where Mr. Trump's newfound alliance with Democrats might lead.
On Thursday morning, the president telephoned Republican leaders to relay news of the dinner discussions; Republicans were left on the defensive, and seemingly flummoxed.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, issued a curt statement saying he and his colleagues "look forward to receiving the Trump administration's legislative proposal," while Mr. Ryan called Wednesday night's talks "a discussion, not an agreement or a negotiation."
