Clinton campaign officials, in another bid to placate the party's left wing, picked Senator Elizabeth Warren to deliver the keynote address on Monday night, hoping that her searing denunciations of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, would unify the delegates in the hall.
Mrs. Clinton had privately chosen Ms. Warren days ago, campaign officials said, but announced her on Monday morning to try to set a positive tone for the first day of the convention and start closing ranks against Mr. Trump.
Mr. Sanders, who took the stage here at about 10:50 p.m. to a thundering three-minute ovation and chants of "Bernie, Bernie," acknowledged the disappointment of his supporters and said, "It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues."
