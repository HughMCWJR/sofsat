Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
Responding to the disclosure by Donna Brazile, who became interim chairwoman of the DNC as last year's election approached, Warren told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that Democratic leaders must restore faith in the party's operations.
"What we've got to do as Democrats now is hold this party accountable," Warren said, adding that the current DNC chairman, former Labor Department Secretary Tom Perez is "being tested."
