WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Friday that he doesn't support the latest Obamacare repeal bill, all but ensuring Republicans' last-ditch effort to gut the Affordable Care Act is dead in the water.
"I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal," McCain said in a statement.
"I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried," he said.
