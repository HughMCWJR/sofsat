Mr. Schiff, who has traded bitter Twitter messages with the president after Mr. Trump called him one of "the biggest liars and leakers" in Washington, warned this week that Mr. Trump might call for "political edits" intended to erase embarrassing parts of the memo, not information related to national security.
In a statement on Friday night, Mr. Schiff said that Democrats had provided their memo to the F.B.I.
and the Justice Department for vetting before it was approved for release by the committee.
