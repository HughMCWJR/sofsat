Alabama is the latest state to bear bad news to recipients of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), warning families Monday that it will no longer enroll children starting Jan. 1, 2018 and will terminate the program entirely on Feb. 1, 2018 if Congress fails to act.
Congressional lawmakers have yet to renew federal funding for CHIP since the program expired on Sept. 30.
Since then, state officials have had to relay devastating news of funding shortages to families of modest incomes right around the holidays.
