It's the culmination of a year-long effort to use the president's clemency power to get hundreds of people -- most of them nonviolent drug offenders -- out of prison sooner.
And it tops off another presidential record: With 1,927 people granted some form of clemency, Obama has used his clemency powers more than any president since Harry Truman (excluding Gerald Ford's clemency for thousands of Vietnam War draft dodgers).
By using the president's pardon powers and shortening the prison sentences of 330 prison inmates convicted of drug crimes, he made Thursday the biggest use of clemency by a president in a single day in US history -- breaking a record he himself set earlier in the week.
