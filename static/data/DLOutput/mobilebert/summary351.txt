Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted the White House on Sunday for how it handled Russian hacks in the runup to the election, saying the U.S response to the meddling has been "paralyzed" so far.
"There's no doubt they were interfering.
"The president has no strategy and no policy as to what to do about these various cyberattacks that have possibly disrupted an American election," McCain told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union."
