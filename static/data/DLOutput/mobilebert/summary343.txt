President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed Friday on a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities in the presidential election -- after he spent this week still questioning the veracity of their previous assessments.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that an unclassified version of the report will be made public early next week.
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday, Clapper previewed some of the report's findings.
