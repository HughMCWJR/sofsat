About an hour later, the White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump had refused to take a phone call on Friday from Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro.
"It is an act of supreme extremism," Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said late Friday in Caracas, the capital.
"President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country."
