Mr. Kim made his comments on Saturday at a meeting of the Central Committee of his ruling Workers' Party, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on Sunday.
He also reconfirmed his policy of simultaneously seeking progress in his nuclear weapons program and pushing for economic growth in the face of expanding international sanctions.
The remarks indicated that Mr. Kim had no intention of retreating under American pressure even as South Korean officials and analysts worry that the North will conduct a major weapons test to observe the anniversary on Tuesday of the founding of the Workers' Party.
