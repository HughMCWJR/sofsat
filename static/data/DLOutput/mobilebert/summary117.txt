A total of 18 states as well as Washington D.C., signed onto the lawsuit on Friday after the White House announced on Thursday that the billions of dollars in subsidies would end, according to CNBC.
The attorneys general for New York, California and over a dozen other states filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump's administration in an effort to block their decision to cut off subsidy payments made to health insurance companies that sell coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman called the administration's decision "cruel," "breathtakingly reckless" and "awful," CNBC reported.
