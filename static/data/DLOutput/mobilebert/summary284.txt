Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) moved to hold a series of "pro-forma" sessions while senators are away for the month of August.
The Senate unanimously approved a procedure that will block Trump from making recess appointments during August.
Every few days a Republican senator will preside over an empty chamber for about a minute.
