Donald Trump's approval rating has reached a historic new low in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, with almost half of Americans believing the country to be weaker since he took office.
According to the poll, just 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump's performance as president, down six points from Trump's 100 days approval rating--which was itself the lowest for any president in polling history at that point.
The only other president whose approval ratings were as poor six months into his tenure was Gerald Ford, whose approval ratings stood at 39 percent in February 1975.
