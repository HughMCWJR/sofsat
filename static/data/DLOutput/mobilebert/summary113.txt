Parents and children in Mississippi have chosen to rename an elementary school serving predominantly black students in honor of the first black president, changing the moniker from one honoring a Confederate leader.
School stakeholders voted on Oct. 5 to approve the name change, PTA President Janelle Jefferson announced at a Tuesday evening meeting of the district's board of trustees.
"The school community wanted to rename the campus to reflect a person who fully represents ideals and public stances consistent with what we want our children to believe about themselves," said Jefferson.
