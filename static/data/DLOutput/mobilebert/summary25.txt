President Donald Trump blasted the media as "fake news" and criticized journalists for taking part in the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday.
"A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capitol right now," he said.
While speaking to reporters at the Ames Companies headquarters ahead of the rally, Trump struck a less critical tone about the dinner.
