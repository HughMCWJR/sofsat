The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California.
Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis' order won't have any immediate effect on Dreamers.
But the second injunction marks a win for Trump's opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress.
