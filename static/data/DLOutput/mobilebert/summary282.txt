Susana Bates/AFP/Getty Images On Saturday, Motherboard reported that an anti-diversity manifesto penned by James Damore, a software engineer at Google, had gone "internally viral" at the company--and then, after Gizmodo obtained and published the 10-page document, it went viral-viral.
The screed aired its author's qualms with diversity and inclusion initiatives at Google, programs he deemed a waste of time because women are inherently less suited for technical roles than men.
Or as he put it, in a faux-measured tone: "I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership."
