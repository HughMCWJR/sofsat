Citing "sources briefed on the matter," the network said a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., approved the charges, which have been sealed by a federal judge.
CNN did not indicate who had been charged, how many people had been charged, or what charges had been filed by Mueller's team.
An arrest could come by Monday.
