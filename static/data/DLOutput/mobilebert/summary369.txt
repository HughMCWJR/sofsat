The campaign has taken a number of steps since election day to review election results and has not found "any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology," Marc Elias, the campaign's general counsel, wrote in a statement on Medium.
The campaign had not planned to call for a recount, Elias wrote, but now that one is underway, it felt an obligation to participate.
Hillary Clinton's campaign on Saturday said that it would participate in a recount initiated by Green Party nominee Jill Stein in Wisconsin and said it would take similar action if a recount was initiated in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
