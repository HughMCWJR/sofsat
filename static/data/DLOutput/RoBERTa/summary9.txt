A single student's case has turned into a massive legal decision for all transgender Americans.
In the decision, a three-judge panel from the Seventh Circuit Court concluded that the school district "has failed to provide any evidence of how the preliminary injunction will harm it, or any of its students or parents" -- a rebuke of the prevalent myth that letting trans people use the bathroom for their gender identity will hurt others.
That case briefly rose to the US Supreme Court, which LGBTQ advocates hoped would decide the legal issue -- of whether Title IX really applies to trans people.
