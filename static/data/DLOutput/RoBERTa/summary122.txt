WASHINGTON -- The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and "it is not being extended at this time," Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.
DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act -- an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island -- on Sept. 28.
Nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans on the island still don't have drinking water since Maria hit nearly three weeks ago.
