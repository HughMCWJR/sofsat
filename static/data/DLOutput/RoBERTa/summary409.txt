HOUSTON -- The Green Party officially nominated Massachusetts physician and progressive activist Jill Stein as its presidential candidate on Saturday, also selecting human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.
"I want to recognize the people coming out of the Bernie Sanders campaign who helped launched a revolutionary political movement," Stein told the assembled delegates on Saturday morning during remarks by the party's presidential candidates.
"[ Officials with the Stein campaign and Green Party spent far more of the convention appealing to Democrats disillusioned by Hillary Clinton's campaign than Republican disillusioned by Donald Trump's, a not very surprising development given the party's liberal platform.
