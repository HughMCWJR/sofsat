A letter from the University of Chicago's dean of students to the incoming students of the class of 2020 has been making the rounds on social media the past few days.
Despite the apocalyptic tone that often accompanies screeds against supposedly coddled students and their trigger-free safe spaces, the issues involved strike me as far more complicated than the overheated rhetoric suggests.
Students deserve much more credit than they get in the UChicago letter
I'm dismayed by how diatribes like the Chicago letter approach students in adversarial terms, implying that they don't know how to make choices or approach material when it comes to their learning.
