On Aug. 15, Mr. Cohn stood nearby in the lobby of Trump Tower, where the president told reporters there also were "very fine people on both sides" of the Charlottesville rally.
As Mr. Trump stood by his equivocal comments on Charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest, Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, he felt "enormous pressure" to step down.
Various friends, and Mr. Cohn's wife, were at one point among those who were urging him to resign, said several people familiar with their advice.
