As Trump meets with UK Prime Minister Teresa May, he should expect a cool reception and a reminder that sharing official information like "locker-room talk" threatens the special relationship between British and American intelligence services.
In Brussels on Thursday for a NATO summit at which Trump will also be present, May said she would "make clear" to the U.S. president that leaking of sensitive information to the media must cease, the Press Association reported.
Trump has often gone on the attack against "leakers," but that desire to turn off the tap has been uniformly related to people who spill information about his own misstatements, misdeeds, and deceptions.
