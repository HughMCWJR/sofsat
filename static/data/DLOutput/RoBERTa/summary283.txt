Illinois Gov.
Bruce Rauner (R) has signed a law designating Aug. 4 as "Barack Obama Day" in the state, the governor's office confirmed Friday.
It's not a legal holiday -- schools and state offices remained open Friday -- but is intended to celebrate Obama's career and recognize his political roots in the state.
