The deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the Trump administration on Sunday to block the president's appointment of Mick Mulvaney as interim director of the agency.
"As the rightful acting director of the Bureau, Ms. English brings this action against President Trump and Mr. Mulvaney seeking a declaratory judgment and, on an emergency basis, a temporary restraining order to prevent the defendants from appointing, causing the appointment of, recognizing the appointment of, or acting on the appointment of an acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau via any mechanism other than that provided for [by the law]," the suit reads.
He pushed back against Trump's assertions that the White House had the authority to appoint an interim director without Congressional approval, saying the CFPB was formed with an eye towards autonomy.
