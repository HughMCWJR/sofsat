Once upon a time, the 1936 film Reefer Madness attempted to spread sensationalistic messages about marijuana to youths across the land.
This knowledge, plus widespread social acceptance - a recent Gallup poll found that one in eight US adults admits to smoking the stuff, and more than half have tried it - have led to a gradual liberalization of marijuana laws on the state level, to the point where 29 states plus Washington DC have legalized medical marijuana.
Eight states have gone a step further and legalized it for recreational use, allowing people over the age of 21 to enjoy it responsibly.
