A day before leaving office, President Barack Obama broke one of his own records.
In early 2014, the Obama administration decided it would do a 180 on the pardon office -- and try to use it as a way to affirmatively get people out of prison.
It replaced the pardon attorney with a prisoners rights advocate, and encouraged thousands of federal prisoners who'd been sentenced under now-obsolete laws or policies to apply to get their sentences reduced to current levels.
