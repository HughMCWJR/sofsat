Donald Trump Trump praises China and blames US for trade deficit President says he does not blame Beijing 'for taking advantage' of US, and is confident it will defuse North Korea threat
US president Donald Trump takes part in a welcoming ceremony with China's president Xi Jinping in Beijing.
Speaking on Thursday at the the Great Hall of the People, the ceremonial heart of Communist party rule, Trump paid tribute to his "warm and gracious" host, and said he appreciated Xi's support for recent efforts to rein in North Korea's weapons programmes.
"Trade between China and the United States has not been, over the last many, many years, a very fair one for us," Trump told an audience of business leaders and journalists, describing the relationship as "shockingly" unbalanced and costing the US $300bn (PS229bn) a year.
