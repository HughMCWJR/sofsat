Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's powerful denunciation Thursday of "alt-right" extremism that she said GOP opponent Donald Trump embraces was cheered by adherents of the political philosophy.
"She is doing the white nationalism movement a great service by bringing attention to our issues to the forefront of political debate," said William Johnson, a leader of the white nationalist American Freedom Party who was selected by Trump as a California delegate during the primary, but later resigned.
Richard Spencer, head of white nationalist think tank National Policy Institute who is credited with coining the term "alternative right," wrote in an online journal that Clinton's speech is "empowering."
