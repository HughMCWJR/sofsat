AMY GOODMAN: On Thursday, the National Rifle Association said it would support additional regulation on the gun accessory known as bump stocks.
Investigators believe the devise was used in Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who killed killed 59 people, including himself, and injured at least 500 people.
But many say the "bump stocks" regulation doesn't go near far enough to prevent future mass shootings.
