The gang that couldn't shoot straight
House Republicans are set to "definitely" roll out their plan to cut taxes for the wealthy on Thursday.
And this must be done in such a way so as to sidestep Senate budget reconciliation rules, which means, making sure Senate Democrats can't stop this budgetary madness with pesky things like votes.
And hope that--like they did with their "health care" bill--Republicans fail again.
