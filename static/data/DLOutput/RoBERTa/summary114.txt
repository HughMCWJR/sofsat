As National Football League owners and players' union representatives meet in New York today and tomorrow to discuss the players' recent demonstrations -- the kneeling, linking arms or raising fists during the national anthem -- they should know how the law views these protests.
Under the First Amendment, which protects free speech and free association, the president of the United States could not enforce a law that, say, required football players to stand during the anthem.
Thus the Constitution should protect the players from corporate retaliation at federal behest.
