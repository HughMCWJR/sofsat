With the aid of tugboats, the Fitzgerald returned on Saturday to its port, the American base at Yokosuka, Japan, south of Tokyo.
Photographs showed the side of the Fitzgerald caved in about one-third of the way back.
Among the compartments that flooded were cabins where 116 sailors were sleeping, Admiral Aucoin said.
