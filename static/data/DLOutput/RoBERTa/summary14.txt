VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be a peacemaker at their highly anticipated first meeting on Wednesday, and Trump promised he would not forget the pontiff's message.
Both men looked far more relaxed at the end of the private meeting, with the pope smiling and joking with Trump and his wife Melania.
"A person who says 'no walls, but bridges,' and the other who says 'walls, not bridges,' is something which you cannot reconcile," Italian newspaper columnist Massimo Franco said.
