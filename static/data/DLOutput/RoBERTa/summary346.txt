The 115th Congress is being sworn in today, with the Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate.
When President-elect Donald Trump takes office, it'll be the first time in a decade the GOP is in charge of both houses of Congress and the White House.
Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying: "Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions.
