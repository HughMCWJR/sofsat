Puerto Rico will receive humanitarian crisis relief from the poverty group Oxfam, which has slammed the Trump administration's "slow and inadequate" response to the unfolding crisis.
Maxman said that response left her "outraged" at the U.S. government's failure to address the most urgent needs of Puerto Ricans who remain without electricity and clean water.
Hurricane Maria hit the island September 20, destroying homes and leaving Puerto Rican residents stranded without communication.
