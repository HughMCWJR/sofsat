There's a ticking time bomb built right into the Senate Republican health care bill.
Keeping protections for pre-existing conditions means sicker people have access to health coverage and medical care, which is good for them but increases costs for everyone else in the insurance pool.
The Senate reportedly considered provisions that might have helped, such as automatically enrolling everyone who doesn't already have insurance in a basic, high-deductible insurance plan, but the version of the legislation released Thursday includes nothing of the sort.
