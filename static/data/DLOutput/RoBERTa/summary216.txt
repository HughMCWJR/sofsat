WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal and longtime opponent of marijuana, will allow the nation's top federal prosecutors to decide how to handle marijuana cases in states where the drug has been legalized.
It will likely leave those in legal marijuana businesses uncertain whether the U.S. attorney in their district will resume enforcing federal law, which still regards marijuana as illegal.
A senior department official said Sessions' new memo removes the "de-facto safe harbor" that existed under Obama policy. "
