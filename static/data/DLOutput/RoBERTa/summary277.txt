President Donald Trump condemned hate groups, including white supremacists, in remarks from the White House on Monday, after receiving criticism for his initial statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the [Ku Klux Klan], neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."
A White House official later elaborated on Trump's comments, indicating that he was opposed to the "hatred, bigotry and violence from all sources and all sides" and noting that "there was violence between protesters and counterprotesters."
