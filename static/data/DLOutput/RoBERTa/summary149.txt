President Trump didn't take long to fire back at his former political opponent Hillary Clinton, one day after his provocative speech at the United Nations that threatened North Korea's existence.
In the early morning hours on Wednesday, Trump blamed Clinton for North Korea's nuclear program in a tweet insinuating that the former Secretary of State did not do enough when she was the nation's top diplomat.
He posted that Clinton, who he again called "Crooked Hillary," is criticizing only now after "allowing" the country to "research and build" nuclear weapons.
