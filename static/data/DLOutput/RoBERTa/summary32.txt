The remarks at a Group of 7 foreign ministers' meeting here in the Tuscany region of Italy came just before Mr. Tillerson flew to Moscow to meet with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
Mr. Putin, at an appearance with President Sergio Mattarella of Italy, said on Tuesday that the chemical attack was "worth investigating thoroughly," and he said Russia would formally ask the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for an inquiry.
With his comments, Mr. Tillerson tried to untangle the confusing mix of signals from the Trump administration over whether the United States conducted the missile strike for humanitarian or national security reasons, and whether the Trump administration seeks an immediate change of government in Syria.
