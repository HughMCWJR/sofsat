Gen Michael Flynn has promised "full cooperation" in the special counsel's Russia investigation and, according to a confidant, is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.
The confidant provided ABC News with new details on Friday about Trump's instructions to Flynn.
Sentencing has been put off for now -- and the judge noted that Flynn is agreeing to cooperate with authorities in other matters.
