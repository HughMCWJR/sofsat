White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly on Monday brushed aside charges leveled at three Trump campaign aides as part of the special counsel's investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election, but endorsed a new independent prosecutor to delve into a 2010 uranium company deal that has become a rallying cry for opponents of Hillary Clinton.
In fact, the investigation, being directed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, covered the period in which all three served under Trump.
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians during the campaign.
