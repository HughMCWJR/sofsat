When newly hired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was brought on board, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who had also been serving as a communications director, gave his notice.
But just 10 days after Scaramucci's first unofficial day and more than two weeks ahead of his official start date, Scaramucci has been removed from his post -- and Spicer appears to still work in the White House.
On Thursday, July 27, the New Yorker published reporter Ryan Lizza's account of a profanity-laced phone call he received from Scaramucci, in which Scaramucci insulted Priebus as "a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.")
