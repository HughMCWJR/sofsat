WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that transgender people will no longer be allowed to serve in the U.S. military "in any capacity" -- a stunning reversal of an Obama-era policy that affects thousands of service members.
The right-wing Family Research Council was among the first out with a statement praising Trump for taking the step.
The military can now focus its efforts on preparing to fight and win wars rather than being used to advance the Obama social agenda."
