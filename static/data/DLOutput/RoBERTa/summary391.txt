Elected officials who have paid any attention to the killings of civilians by the police that have roiled several cities in recent years should understand that keeping the public in the dark heightens tension and undermines trust in law enforcement.
The department -- which has said that Mr. Scott brandished a gun when he was shot dead -- has refused to make public the video that might show how the shooting occurred.
Police Chief Kerr Putney added to that anger at a news conference on Thursday when he said that the video did not give him "absolute, definitive, visual evidence that would confirm that a person is pointing a gun," though he insisted that there was evidence to suggest that the police account of the event was correct.
