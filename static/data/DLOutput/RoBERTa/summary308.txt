Donald Trump's approval rating has reached a historic new low in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, with almost half of Americans believing the country to be weaker since he took office.
According to the poll, just 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump's performance as president, down six points from Trump's 100 days approval rating--which was itself the lowest for any president in polling history at that point.
The American people's support for President Trump has weakened since the spring as the White House has faced a stalled agenda overshadowed by investigations into Russian meddling, a perceived decline in American leadership worldwide, and struggling GOP efforts to pass a healthcare bill unpopular with the American people.
