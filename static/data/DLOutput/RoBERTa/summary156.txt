U.S. House lawmakers on Tuesday adopted a trio of bipartisan measures meant to rein in civil asset forfeiture, a controversial law enforcement practice that allows police to confiscate property from individuals without ever convicting them of a crime, and often without even charging them.
"Under this dubious practice, law enforcement may seize a citizen's cash and property simply because someone suspects it of being connected to criminal activity, without convicting, indicting, arresting or even charging the property owner with having committed a crime and without proving or even alleging in court that the property is somehow connected to criminal activity," Raskin said.

Rep. Tim Walberg (R-Mich.), another reliable opponent of civil forfeiture, also spoke in favor of his version of the amendment, before urging his colleagues to take more aggressive legislative action to address abuses of the practice.
