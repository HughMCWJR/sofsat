Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced Monday that she would vote against a new bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, leaving Republicans at least one vote short of what it would take to pass it -- and dealing what looks like a lethal blow to this latest effort at Obamacare repeal.
That bill would cut Medicaid, replace the Affordable Care Act with a less generous set of grants to the states and weaken key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Collins had said she would not announce her position on the bill until seeing the CBO report, and she cited those findings as evidence of the "devastating impact" Medicaid cuts and changes to insurance regulations would have on her constituents.
