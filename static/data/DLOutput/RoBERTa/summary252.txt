There will be no armistice in the ugly feud between President Donald Trump and CNN this holiday season.
The cable news network announced late Tuesday night that it will boycott the White House's annual Christmas party for members of the media, news that will come as an early Christmas gift for Trump and his staff.
In keeping with the president's petty attacks on CNN and other liberal media outlets, Trump's press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders rejoiced that the boycott was "finally, good news from CNN."
