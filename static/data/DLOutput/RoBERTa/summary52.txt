On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will deliver an address to a joint session of Congress in Washington, the biggest speech he's given since his inaugural address back on Jan. 20.

Mr. Trump is expected to do much of that in his speech to Congress: he'll outline his policy priorities and help frame the first year of his presidency, doing so before members of the Cabinet and the full Congress.
