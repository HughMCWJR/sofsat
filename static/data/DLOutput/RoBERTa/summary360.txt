Mr. Trump, according to a person briefed on the decision, has not yet formally offered the job to General Kelly, who is out of the country.
"One positive thing is that he understands the problem of root causes of immigration," said Mr. Sharry, noting that General Kelly had spoken about the need to stem violence in Central American countries, a core cause of immigration toward the United States.
General Kelly would be the third retired general to get a senior position in Mr. Trump's cabinet, reflecting the president-elect's comfort with military men in important national security posts.
