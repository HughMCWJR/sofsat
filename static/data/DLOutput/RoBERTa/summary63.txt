Give them credit for this one: Democrats have fought hard to stop Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump's blazingly unqualified pick for education secretary.
Democrats took the Senate floor and spoke all night against DeVos, raising some damn good points:
"When presented with a nominee who says that public education is a 'dead end' for students in this country, people take it personally," [Sen. Chris Murphy] said, referring to a 2015 speech given by DeVos. "
The less serious, though mostly accurate, one is that she is plainly inexperienced.
