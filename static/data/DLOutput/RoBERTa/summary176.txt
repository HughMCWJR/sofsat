Donald Trump -- the man who led "lock her up" chants for months; who, as recently as January, called for one of his political opponents' top aides to be jailed; and who, 29 years ago, called for the execution of the wrongly accused "Central Park Five" -- has suddenly discovered a concern for due process.
According to Cornell Law School, due process in the United States refers to a right enumerated in the Fifth Amendment and a clause in the 14th Amendment; the two correspond but aren't the same.
There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone.
