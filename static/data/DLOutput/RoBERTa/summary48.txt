Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and one of the most high profile federal prosecutors in the country, says he's been fired after refusing to resign his post.
"One hallmark of justice is absolute independence, and that was my touchstone everyday I served," he said.
It is typical for new administrations to wipe the slate clean of U.S. attorneys after entering office, but former President Barack Obama did so on a rolling basis, allowing Bush holdovers to stay on until their successors were confirmed.
