CNN is reporting that the Trump campaign--including candidate Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and others--were offered access to Wikileaks documents, including special access to a Wikileaks website, a month before Wikileaks began publishing documents stolen from John Podesta's account to the public.
Trump Jr. told investigators he had no recollection of the September email.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and efforts to reach WikiLeaks for comment were unsuccessful.
