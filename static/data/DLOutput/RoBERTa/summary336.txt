Amid reports that he's under investigation for obstruction of justice, President Donald Trump said Thursday that investigators should examine unspecified "dealings" that Hillary Clinton and Democrats have with Russia, as opposed to his "non-dealings."
He also brought up Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and questioned whether her actions amounted to obstruction of justice.
"Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?"
