Trump administration Trump drops climate change from US national security strategy President outlined new approach in unprecedented White House speech
Obama administration added climate to list of threats to US interests Donald Trump has dropped climate change from America's national security strategy.
The Federalist website, which first reported that Trump would drop climate change from the NSS, quoted the draft document as suggesting the Trump administration would actively oppose efforts to reduce the burning of oil, gas and coal for energy.
"US leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth energy agenda that is detrimental to US economic and energy security interests," the website quoted the document as saying.
