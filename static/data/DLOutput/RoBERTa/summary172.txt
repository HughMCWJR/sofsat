A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president's efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children.
It could also complicate Trump's own efforts in the courts.
The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration's request -- unless the new injunction delays that process.
