Within minutes of President Trump's nomination of federal judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, several hundred demonstrators had converged on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to protest his selection.
"Leave it to Trump to distract the country from a constitutional crisis by appointing a right-wing litmus test judge to the court," said Nancy Schoolmacher of College Park, Maryland. "
The night began when Trump, in a short White House speech, nominated Judge Gorsuch from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to the court.
