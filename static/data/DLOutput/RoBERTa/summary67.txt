President Donald Trump will sign on Friday an executive order to water down the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory framework put into effect in response to the financial crisis, according to a senior White House official.
The Trump administration told NBC News, "This is not an attempt to undo Dodd-Frank," but rather a plan to generate "fairly immediate and dramatic impact."
The memorandum targets the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule that, when it begins to phase in April 10, would elevate all financial professionals dealing with retirement plans to the level of fiduciary, with increased ethics and legal duties that could effect the retirement accounts they offered and their relationship with clients.
