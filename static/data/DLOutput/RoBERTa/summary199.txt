The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the state's congressional map went so far to benefit Republicans that it "clearly, plainly and palpably" violated the state constitution.
The court, where Democrats have a 5-2 majority, blocked the use of the map in the 2018 midterm elections, ordered state lawmakers to begin to draw a new map.
The justices indicated the state's congressional primary on May 15 would proceed as scheduled.
