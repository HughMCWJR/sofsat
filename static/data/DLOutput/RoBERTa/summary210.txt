A lawyer for President Donald Trump arranged a payment of $130,000 to a former adult film actress in October 2016, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal citing sources familiar with the matter.
Michael Cohen, a longtime representative of the Trump Organization, reportedly negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with a lawyer for the woman, Stephanie Clifford, over an encounter that allegedly occurred in 2006.
Clifford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
