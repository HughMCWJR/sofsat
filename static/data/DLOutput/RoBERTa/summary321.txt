WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's commission on election integrity is facing significant hurdles, as multiple state election officials have said they will not comply with the panel's request this week for specific, sensitive voter information.
The Minnesota and South Dakota secretaries of state said they would not comply with the commission's request.
An administrator from the Maryland state board of elections also declined to provide voters' information, saying in a letter to Kobach that his request "may be prohibited under State and/or federal law."
