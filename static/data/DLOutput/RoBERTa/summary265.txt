Last Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) made some stunning comments to local media assessing President's Donald Trump's performance over the first seven months of his term.
He added, "[Trump] also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation."
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has not briefed the media since Corker made his remarks.
