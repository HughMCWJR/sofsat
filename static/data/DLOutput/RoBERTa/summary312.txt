President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that his son Donald Trump Jr. is "innocent" and news that he met with a Kremlin-linked lawyer is part of "the greatest Witch Hunt in political history."
The president had released a brief statement through White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders a day earlier, calling his son "a high-quality person."
This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history.
