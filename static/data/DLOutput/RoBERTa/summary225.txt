In a renewed push to clamp down on the influx of illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border, the Trump administration is reportedly weighing a policy that would separate parents from their children in detention centers.

The administration is committed to using all legal tools at its disposal to secure our nation's borders and as a result we are continuing to review additional policy options."
