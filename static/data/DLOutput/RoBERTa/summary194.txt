DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Trump sought to repair one diplomatic rift while widening another on Thursday as he smoothed over months of friction with Britain but threatened to cut financial aid to the Palestinians after they withdrew from peace discussions.
Separate meetings with the prime ministers of Britain and Israel showcased the wide disparity in Mr. Trump's ties with key counterparts.
The strain between the United States and Britain, its closest ally, increased when Mr. Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos posted by an ultranationalist British group, which Mrs. May called "wrong," and culminated in his decision to cancel a scheduled visit to London, where the mayor declared him unwelcome.
