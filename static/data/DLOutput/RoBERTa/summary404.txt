Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a "stark contrast" with Mr. Trump, whom she accused of "hiding behind fake excuses."
The Trump campaign would not discuss his tax returns, but in a statement on Friday, a spokesman, Jason Miller, called Mrs. Clinton's disclosure an effort to shield her from questions about her emails when she was secretary of state and about what favors were sought by donors to her family's foundation.
"This document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection by an individual who created and then purged an illegal private email server," he said.
