U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could soon be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, The New York Times and The Associated Press reported Thursday.
While meeting with the Crown Prince of Bahrain Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa on Thursday, Trump told reporters Tillerson was at the White House but ignored questions about Tillerson's future with the State Department.
In March, Tillerson admitted he "didn't want this job."
