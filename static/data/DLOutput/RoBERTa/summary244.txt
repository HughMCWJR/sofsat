WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Al Franken will announce his decision to remain in or resign from the U.S. Senate on Thursday after facing intense pressure from members of his own party to step down following allegations of sexual misconduct.
But a majority of his Democratic Senate colleagues, including most of the party's women lawmakers in the chamber, pressed him to step down on Wednesday after a fresh allegation hit the news.
If Franken leaves, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, a fellow Democrat, would appoint someone to take his place, meaning Democrats do not risk losing the seat for now.
