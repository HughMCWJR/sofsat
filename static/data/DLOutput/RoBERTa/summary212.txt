Immigration activists protesting the Trump administration's decision on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program outside of Trump Tower in New York.
On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined--that is, blocked--Trump's attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.
But Alsup ruled that while the lawsuit is pending, anyone who had DACA status when the program was rescinded Sept. 5 can renew it, officials said.
