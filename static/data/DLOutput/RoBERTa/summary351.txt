blasted the White House on Sunday for how it handled Russian hacks in the runup to the election, saying the U.S response to the meddling has been "paralyzed" so far.

Speaking to reporters Friday, President Barack Obama defended the White House response to the cyberattacks, saying the administration wanted to be careful not to incite more hacking that could tip vote counts.
