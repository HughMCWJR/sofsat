WASHINGTON -- Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has issued a subpoena to the Trump campaign asking multiple campaign officials to produce Russia-related documents, according to a source with first-hand knowledge of the matter.
The subpoena was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also said that the subpoena does not compel testimony by any of the officials.
A subpoena ratchets up the stakes for noncompliance.
