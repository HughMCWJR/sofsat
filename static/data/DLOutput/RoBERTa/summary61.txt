The feud between McCain and Trump can be traced back to the start of his 2016 presidential campaign.
After McCain claimed that Trump was drawing "crazies " to his campaign with racist comments about Mexicans, Trump infamously insulted the Vietnam-era war hero by declaring, "He's not a war hero. '
Hard feelings between the two lasted throughout the 2016 election and have clearly continued into Trump's presidency.
