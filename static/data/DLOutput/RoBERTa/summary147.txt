Brown University wants to replace all loans in student aid packages with grants that do not have to be paid back, the school announced in a press release on Wednesday.
When students and their families are sitting at their dining room tables making decisions about where to apply to college, or whether to accept an offer of admission, we want them to know that Brown is an affordable choice."
The new policy aims to help students from "families with moderate income" who do not qualify for full financial aid packages but cannot cover the full cost of college on their own, according to the university's statement.
