As delegates streamed out, a handful of Mr. Sanders's most dedicated supporters held up his signs and chanted, "Hey, hey, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary."
Clinton campaign officials, in another bid to placate the party's left wing, picked Senator Elizabeth Warren to deliver the keynote address on Monday night, hoping that her searing denunciations of Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, would unify the delegates in the hall.
Ms. Warren opened her remarks with a warm nod to Mr. Sanders, saying his campaign had advanced liberal causes and helped show that the political and economic systems were "rigged" in favor of the powerful.
