President Trump is throwing his support behind Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his immigration legislation, as the debate over immigration reform continues to play out on Capitol Hill.
It's unclear if the president has since suggested changes to the original version of Grassley's legislation.
The president suggested that with the budget deal behind him, his focus is on "enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform that delivers for the American People."
