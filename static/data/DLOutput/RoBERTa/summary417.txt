Boris Johnson has unexpectedly ruled himself out as a candidate for Britain's next prime minister, after the justice secretary, Michael Gove, sent shockwaves through Westminster with a last-minute bid for the Conservative leadership.
But he concluded by saying he would no longer put his name forward.
"Having consulted colleagues and in view of the circumstances in parliament, I have concluded that person cannot be me," he said, stunning MPs who had assembled to show their support.
