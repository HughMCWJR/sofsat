'We know how to fight,' Trump says
Mr. Trump, appearing at a meeting of faith leaders and politicians in Washington as Mr. Comey testified across town, railed against the media and his political opponents.
Mr. Trump recited Isaiah 1:17, then continued by saying that "entrenched interests" in Washington "will lie, they will obstruct, they will spread their hatred and their prejudice, but we will not back down from doing what is right."
