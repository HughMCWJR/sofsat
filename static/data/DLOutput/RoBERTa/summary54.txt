The White House blocked several news outlets from attending a closed-door briefing Friday afternoon with press secretary Sean Spicer, a decision that drew strong rebukes from news organizations and may only heighten tensions between the press corps and the administration.
The Huffington Post was also denied entry.
However, Spicer said in December the Trump White House would not kick news organizations out of the briefing room over critical coverage.
