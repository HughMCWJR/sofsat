UPDATE (10:50 pm ET): President Donald Trump said he will not immediately quit NAFTA, according to a White House statement released late Wednesday evening.
It is an honor to deal with both President Pena Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau, and I believe that the end result will make all three countries stronger and better," Trump said in the statement.
The White House is considering a draft executive order to withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday.
