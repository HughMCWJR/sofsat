WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Friday lashed out anew at the F.B.I.
director he fired in May, charging that James B. Comey had "exonerated" Hillary Clinton before fully completing the investigation into her use of a private email server.
In an early morning tweet that appeared to seize on a statement from two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee about Mr. Comey's handling of the inquiry, Mr. Trump complained of "a rigged system," returning to his grudge against the former F.B.I.
