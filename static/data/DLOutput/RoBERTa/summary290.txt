"A strong and united NATO is more necessary today than at any point since the collapse of communism a quarter-century ago and no threat looms larger in the Baltic states than the specter of aggression from your unpredictable neighbor to the east," Pence said.
Pence made the comments in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, the first stop on a three-day trip that will also take in Georgia and Montenegro.
