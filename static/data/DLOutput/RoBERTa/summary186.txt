Thousands of Californians will have their misdemeanor pot convictions expunged automatically and thousands more may have felony cases re-categorized, after San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon announced plans to make the state's pot legalization law apply retroactively on Wednesday.
The San Francisco review will stretch back more than 40 years.
One state lawmaker is looking to automate the expungement process statewide through legislation, though the bill is vague and has not yet received a committee hearing date according to the state assembly website.
