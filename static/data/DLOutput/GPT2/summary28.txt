The Murdochs have decided Bill O'Reilly's 21-year run at Fox News will come to an end.
Wednesday morning, according to sources, executives are holding emergency meetings to discuss how they can sever the relationship with the country's highest-rated cable-news host without causing collateral damage to the network.
The board of Fox News' parent company, 21st Century Fox, is scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the matter.
