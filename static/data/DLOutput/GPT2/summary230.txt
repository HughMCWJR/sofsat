Alabama is the latest state to bear bad news to recipients of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), warning families Monday that it will no longer enroll children starting Jan. 1, 2018 and will terminate the program entirely on Feb. 1, 2018 if Congress fails to act.
"My families are affected and I'm really concerned," Goldrick special education teacher Silvia Stantcheva recently told ThinkProgress. "
Kids living in States with separate CHIP programs are most at risk of losing coverage.
