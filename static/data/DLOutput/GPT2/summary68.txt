Within minutes of President Trump's nomination of federal judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, several hundred demonstrators had converged on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to protest his selection.
"This is the most egregious insult in the history of Supreme Court nominations," declared Terry O'Neil, president of the National Organization of Women, triggering a chant of "Stolen seat, stolen seat!"
In fact, of voters who said the Supreme Court was their number one issue, 56 percent of them voted for Trump.
