DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Trump sought to repair one diplomatic rift while widening another on Thursday as he smoothed over months of friction with Britain but threatened to cut financial aid to the Palestinians after they withdrew from peace discussions.
His session with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was tense as they tried to put the relationship back on track, while his sit-down with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was warm as the two agreed on what they cast as Palestinian intransigence.
Sitting down on Thursday with Mrs. May, Mr. Trump said he was now exploring a visit later in the year and dismissed talk of discord as a "false rumor."
