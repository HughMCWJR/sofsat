Congressional Republicans on Monday recrafted their Obamacare replacement bill in hopes of satisfying critics as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to promote his first major legislative initiative on Capitol Hill.
Democrats as well as hospitals and insurers have urged Republicans to consider how their plan would affect access to healthcare for the 20 million people insured by Obamacare.
Their amended bill doesn't actually beef up the tax credits for Americans aged 50 to 64 -- it simply leaves room for the Senate to do it -- though it formalizes agreed-upon changes to Medicaid designed to reel in a vital bloc of conservatives.
