Supervisors Vote 10-1 To Rename Columbus Day To Indigenous Peoples' Day
SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)
San Francisco supervisors today voted 10-1 to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day despite a last-minute effort to delay the vote in response to objections from some members of the city's Italian-American community.
The vote was greeted with a mix of applause and loud boos from the audience.
"I'd like to support something as follow-up legislation to also honor Italian American groups," Yee said.
