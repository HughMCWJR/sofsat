Trucks make their way through flood waters on road leading to the Arkema Inc. chemical plant
An explosion may seem an odd concern in the midst of a raging flood, but the CEO of the Arkema chemical plant near Crosby, Texas has warned that it's all but inevitable that materials stored on site at the plant are going to catch fire and explode.
Some of the compounds stored at the Arkema site require refrigeration to remain stable, but the plant lost power on Sunday due to flooding.
As the temperature increases, the possibility of an explosion also ramps up.
