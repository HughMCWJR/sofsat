SANTA ROSA, Calif. -- An onslaught of relentless wildfires across a wide swath of Northern California broke out almost simultaneously and then grew exponentially, swallowing up properties from wineries to trailer parks and tearing through both tiny rural towns and urban subdivisions.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is visiting California, announced that President Trump approved a "major disaster declaration" for the state to assist in the response.
Some of the largest of the blazes burning over a 200-mile region were in Napa and Sonoma counties, home to dozens of wineries that attract tourists from around the world.
