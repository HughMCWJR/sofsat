The top nuclear commander in the U.S. said Saturday that he would reject an "illegal" nuclear attack order from President Donald Trump, and would instead steer the commander in chief to other "options."
Hyten, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command who oversees America's nuclear arsenal, spoke at a forum titled "Nukes: The Fire and the Fury," as recorded in a video on the event's Facebook page.
In the event Trump suggests an illegal strike, Hyten described a scenario in which he would present Trump with legal choices.
