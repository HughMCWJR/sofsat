Hillary Clinton has finally revealed what she was thinking during her second presidential debate with Donald Trump, when the Republican candidate loomed and leered behind her on a stage in Las Vegas.
In a feisty but relaxed taped interview today with Jane Pauley on CBS Sunday Morning, Clinton also promised that she won't run for office again, but will remain "in politics."
Clinton also said one of biggest regrets from the campaign was not speaking to the "resentment" of white voters. "
