Speaking at the Code Conference in California, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she takes responsibility for her campaign's missteps, while at the same time arguing that she lost last November's election largely for reasons beyond her control.
"I take responsibility for every decision I made, but that's not why I lost," Clinton said.
"They covered it like it was Pearl Harbor," Mrs. Clinton said of the press.
