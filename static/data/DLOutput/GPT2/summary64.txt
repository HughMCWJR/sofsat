In his own self-serving response, Yiannopoulos wrote on Facebook: "One thing we do know for sure: the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down."
That's a gross generalization: Many of Yiannopoulos' critics object to his outrageous statements -- such as his claim that feminism is a "cancer" -- but wouldn't deny his right to express them.
It's also true that one can protest at a speaker's appearance without trying to shout him down.
