Last Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) made some stunning comments to local media assessing President's Donald Trump's performance over the first seven months of his term.
"I think that's a ridiculous and outrageous claim and doesn't dignify a response from this podium," Sanders said.
Well then...
Good thing for Trump that he's maintaining strong relationships with other GOP Senators.
