"On the day that Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton, the floodgates opened on our campaign," Stein said in her acceptance speech.
It also features platform items that fall well to the left of the Democratic Party, including calling for reparations for descendants of slaves and condemning Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory.
