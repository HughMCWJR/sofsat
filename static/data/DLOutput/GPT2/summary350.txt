Beyond politics, the assault made plain that Germany, like France and Belgium, is now a primary European target for mass terror attacks.
On Tuesday evening, the Islamic State issued a statement through its Amaq news agency describing the driver of the truck as "a soldier."
After traveling at least 50 yards, striking scores of people and leaving behind a trail of shattered wood and glass, the truck swerved back toward the street, coming to a stop after it struck a wooden structure, according to German news reports.
