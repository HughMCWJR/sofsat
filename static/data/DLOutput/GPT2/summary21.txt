Forty-five years ago next month a White House conversation took place that will be remembered by history as the one containing the infamous "18-minute gap."
That's the length of time it took from the day Yates informed the White House that its national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had possibly been compromised by the Russian government to the day when President Donald Trump finally fired him.
The Washington Post reported in February that McGahn then "immediately" briefed Trump on the matter.
