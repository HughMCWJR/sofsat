Donald Trump has lavished praise on the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and blamed his own predecessors for the "huge" trade deficit between the world's two largest economies, during his official welcome to Beijing amid an explosion of military splendour and staged adulation.
"Trade between China and the United States has not been, over the last many, many years, a very fair one for us," Trump told an audience of business leaders and journalists, describing the relationship as "shockingly" unbalanced and costing the US $300bn (PS229bn) a year.
