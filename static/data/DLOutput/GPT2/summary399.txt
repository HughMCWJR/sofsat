On white nationalist website Stormfront, there was a call to use the #AltRightMeans tag to counter Clinton's rhetoric about the movement.
That's at least in part related to the higher profile that white supremacy groups have received during Trump's campaign, which has been criticized for not rejecting support from white supremacists like David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard who encouraged other white nationalists to volunteer for Trump's campaign.
