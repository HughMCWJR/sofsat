President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed Friday on a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities in the presidential election -- after he spent this week still questioning the veracity of their previous assessments.
On Thursday, President Obama received a briefing on the report -- prepared by the CIA, FBI and NSA -- which he had ordered in December.
Since the final weeks of the campaign, he also doubted that Russia was responsible.
