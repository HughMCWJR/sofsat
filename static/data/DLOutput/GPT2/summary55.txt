But taken together, the new policies are a rejection of the sometimes more restrained efforts by former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation's borders with fiscal, logistical and humanitarian limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress.
Administration officials said some of the new policies -- like one seeking to send unauthorized border crossers from Central America to Mexico while they await deportation hearings -- could take months to put in effect and might be limited in scope.
But politically, Mr. Kelly's actions on Tuesday serve to reinforce the president's standing among a core constituency -- those who blame unauthorized immigrants for taking jobs away from citizens, committing heinous crimes and being a financial burden on federal, state and local governments.
