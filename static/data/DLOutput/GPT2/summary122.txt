WASHINGTON -- The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and "it is not being extended at this time," Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.
DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act -- an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island -- on Sept. 28.
The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by U.S.-owned and operated ships, which are more expensive vessels than others in the global marketplace.
