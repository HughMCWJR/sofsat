Donald Trump has talked big about the action he was going to take to combat the opioid epidemic, describing it as a "national emergency," which he said he was "saying officially, right now" back in August.
There will be no additional federal funding directed under this order, said an official, who stressed that the Trump administration will work with Congress to fund the Public Health Emergency fund and to increase federal funding in year-end budget deals currently being negotiated in Congress.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been tapped as the Trump administration's opioid czar.
