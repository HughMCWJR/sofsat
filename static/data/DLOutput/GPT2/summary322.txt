With Senate Republicans struggling to come to a consensus on Trumpcare, the repeal and replacement for the Affordable Care Act, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) made a radical, scorched earth proposal to popular vote loser Donald Trump, and of course Trump bit.

This would apparently just cut it off all at once.
