AMY GOODMAN: On Thursday, the National Rifle Association said it would support additional regulation on the gun accessory known as bump stocks.
Investigators believe the devise was used in Sunday night's mass shooting in Las Vegas, in which Stephen Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who killed killed 59 people, including himself, and injured at least 500 people.
The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations," they said.
