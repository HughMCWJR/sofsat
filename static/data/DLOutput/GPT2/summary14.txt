VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be a peacemaker at their highly anticipated first meeting on Wednesday, and Trump promised he would not forget the pontiff's message.
Francis smiled faintly as he greeted Trump outside the study and was not as gregarious as he sometimes is with visiting heads of state.
Trump, seeming subdued, said "it is a great honor."
