Bowe Bergdahl was dishonorably discharged from the Army, but but would not serve any prison time, a military judge ruled Friday.
"The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military," he tweeted from aboard Air Force One.

The sentence also reduced Bergdahl's rank from sergeant to private and will require him to relinquish $1,000 from his salary for each of the next 10 months.
