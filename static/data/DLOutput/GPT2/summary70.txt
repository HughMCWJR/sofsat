Barack Obama's administration handed the Palestinians $221 million (PS177 million) on his last day in office, officials say.
The money, drawn from the U.S. Agency for International Development, is intended for humanitarian assistance in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
In December, Obama decided against using Washington's veto at the U.N. Security Council for a resolution that condemned Israel's building of settlements, considered illegal by much of the international community, in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
