It's hard to miss the fundamental design of the Senate's health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare: a bill that makes deep cuts to services for low-income Americans to pay for tax cuts that would largely benefit the country's wealthiest.
This chart in the CBO's report is a telling diagram of why Republicans are trying so adamantly to gut the program: They're trying to offset the cost of tax cuts to reduce the deficit.
Vox's Sarah Kliff explained this major change in the programs:
This bill would convert Medicaid to a "per capita cap" system, where states would get a lump sum from the federal government for each enrollee.
