Tom Cotton and David Perdue, President Trump unveiled the RAISE Act on Wednesday, an immigration bill that aims to drastically limit legal immigration.
The RAISE Act would bring about sweeping change to American immigration policy.
It would slash in half the number of green cards -- some one million -- issued today, throw out the diversity lottery aimed at attracting immigrants underrepresented in the U.S., and cut down on the number of refugees the U.S. admits.
