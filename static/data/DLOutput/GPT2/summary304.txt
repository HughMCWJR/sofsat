In America, it is legal in most states for police to take and keep your stuff without ever convicting you for a crime.
Police can then absorb the value of the property -- be it cash, cars, guns, or something else -- as profit, either through state programs or under a federal program known as equitable sharing, which lets local and state police get up to 80 percent of the value of what they seize as money for their departments.
Still, the federal government and most states continue to allow civil forfeiture.
