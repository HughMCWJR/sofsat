NBC News is reporting U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state.
By 1977, Exxon's own senior experts had begun to warn the burning of fossil fuels could pose a threat to humanity.
The news of Tillerson's selection comes a day after President Obama ordered a review of Russia's role influencing the presidential election.
