Gen Michael Flynn has promised "full cooperation" in the special counsel's Russia investigation and, according to a confidant, is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.

Contreras then asked Kelner whether he was correct in assuming that Flynn was pleading guilty.
