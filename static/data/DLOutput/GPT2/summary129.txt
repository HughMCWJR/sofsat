On Monday, the Senate will hold a procedural vote on a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks illegal in every state in the country.
"The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will protect the voiceless, the vulnerable, and the marginalized," said Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the House majority leader, in a statement in September (the House passed the bill in early October). "
While the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate because of the 60 votes required, President Donald Trump has promised to sign the it if it passes; during the campaign, he said such a bill "would end painful late-term abortions nationwide."
