The Senate early Wednesday passed the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax-cut plan, putting it closer to President Trump's desk with an additional House vote expected Wednesday.
The Senate passed the slightly modified plan on a 51-48 vote after the House passed its bill earlier in the day on a 227-203 vote.
The procedural hiccup is not expected to significantly delay the proceedings, as the House is expected to take up the Senate-passed version Wednesday.
