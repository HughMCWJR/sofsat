Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office is not staying silent following explosive accusations by a lawyer for President Donald Trump's transition team that the investigators looking into claims of collusion with Moscow during the campaign unlawfully received tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration.
Loewentritt specifically rejected a claim by the transition lawyer that the late GSA general counsel made a commitment to inform Trump's team if there were specific requests for any documents because the campaign "owned and controlled" emails that were sent at the time.
That's surprising and suggests that he has reason to distrust Trump's team.
