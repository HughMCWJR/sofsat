CNN is reporting that the Trump campaign--including candidate Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and others--were offered access to Wikileaks documents, including special access to a Wikileaks website, a month before Wikileaks began publishing documents stolen from John Podesta's account to the public.
It's not clear if the email, which came addressed from "Mike Erickson" is from the same person who later began conversing with Donald Trump Jr. through private messages on Twitter.
Trump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas, told CNN that his client said he had no recollection of the email and took no action on it.
