Senate Republicans Unveil New Health Bill, but Divisions Remain Image The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he intends to take up the revised health care bill next week.
Those changes and others, including a decision to keep a pair of taxes on high-income people and to expand the use of tax-favored health savings accounts, were intended to bridge a vast gap between the Senate's most conservative Republicans, who want less regulation of health insurance, and moderate Republicans concerned about people who would be left uninsured.
Republicans say they are trying to stabilize insurance markets and rescue consumers who face sky-high premiums and deductibles on the Affordable Care Act's exchanges.
