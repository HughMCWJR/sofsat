Brown University wants to replace all loans in student aid packages with grants that do not have to be paid back, the school announced in a press release on Wednesday.
The new policy aims to help students from "families with moderate income" who do not qualify for full financial aid packages but cannot cover the full cost of college on their own, according to the university's statement.
Brown hopes to raise $30 million by December in order to eliminate loans starting in the 2018-19 academic year.
