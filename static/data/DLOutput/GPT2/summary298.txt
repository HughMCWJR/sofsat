Once again, Donald Trump is using his morning Twitter fit as a way to attack, not just Hillary Clinton, but the attorney general he put in office.
x Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!
-- Instead, he'd just prefer that sessions quit.
