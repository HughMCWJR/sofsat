Senate passage of a bipartisan bill could perhaps leave Mr. Trump with the take-it-or-leave-it decision.
Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona -- Republicans who have in the past fought against hard-line immigration policies -- said the Senate was unlikely to simply accept the president's legislation.
Under Mr. Trump's plan, described to reporters by senior White House officials, young immigrants who were brought into the United States illegally as children would be granted legal status, would be allowed to work, and could become citizens over a 10-to-12-year period if they remained out of trouble with the law.
