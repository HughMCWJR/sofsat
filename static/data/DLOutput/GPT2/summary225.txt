In a renewed push to clamp down on the influx of illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border, the Trump administration is reportedly weighing a policy that would separate parents from their children in detention centers.
This new policy, according to The New York Times, would place parents in adult detention centers and children either in separate shelters or in the care of "sponsors."
"It's cruel for parents to place the lives of their children in the hands of transnational criminal organizations and smugglers who have zero respect for human life and often abuse or abandon children," he said in a statement.
