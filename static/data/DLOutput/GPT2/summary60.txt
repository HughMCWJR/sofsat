WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have confirmed that President Donald Trump's campaign aides and associates had constant contact with Russian intelligence officials before the election, directly contradicting public statements made by top administration officials.
On Jan. 15, shortly before Trump took office, Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly said on television that there were zero contacts between the campaign and Russian officials.
"There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period," Spicer said.
