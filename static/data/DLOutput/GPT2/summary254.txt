WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are moving quickly toward a vote on their tax proposal this week, with GOP leaders still tweaking the bill to win over reluctant Republicans.
There are a number of other senators who seem to have serious reservations about the bill, and, if every Democrat votes no, as expected, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) If it is included, that could endanger the support of Collins and Murkowski.
For one, Corker is open to taking a baseline of the bill that wouldn't account for expiring measures being reauthorized.
