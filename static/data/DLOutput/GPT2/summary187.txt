President Donald Trump is currently deciding whether or not to release a controversial secret memo, compiled by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), that alleges an anti-Trump conspiracy at the FBI.
Now the FBI itself has weighed in against releasing the memo.
After his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Trump told Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) he would "100 percent" make the memo public in the coming days.
