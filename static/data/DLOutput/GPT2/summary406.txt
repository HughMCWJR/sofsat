The US state department has turned over 44 previously unreleased Hillary Clinton email exchanges that the Democratic presidential nominee failed to include among the 30,000 private messages she turned over to the government last year.
They show her interacting with lobbyists, political and Clinton Foundation donors and business interests as secretary of state.
