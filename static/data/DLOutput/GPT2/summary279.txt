President Trump's remarks on Friday that he would not rule out a "military option" to quell the chaos in Venezuela set off a late-night diplomatic duel, with the defense minister accusing Mr. Trump of "an act of madness" and the White House saying it had turned away a call from Venezuela's president.
"It is an act of supreme extremism," Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said late Friday in Caracas, the capital.
About an hour later, the White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump had refused to take a phone call on Friday from Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro.
