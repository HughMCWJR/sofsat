President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his push for his executive order banning travel and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries, lashing out against his own Justice Department and potentially exacerbating the continued legal battle over the order.
Trump's statements about the ban have already been used against him in court.
Trump politicized a terror attack in London on Saturday evening, using it as evidence to promote and justify his order, even before the full details of the attack became known.
