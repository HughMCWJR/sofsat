Donald Trump's approval rating has reached a historic new low in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, with almost half of Americans believing the country to be weaker since he took office.
According to the poll, just 36 percent of Americans approve of Trump's performance as president, down six points from Trump's 100 days approval rating--which was itself the lowest for any president in polling history at that point.
However, there was some good news for the president, with 43 percent approving of his handling of the economy (41 percent disapprove).
