The deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the Trump administration on Sunday to block the president's appointment of Mick Mulvaney as interim director of the agency.
Leandra English filed suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Donald Trump and Mulvaney, who currently serves as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
"It is my legal opinion that the president possesses the authority to designate an acting director for the bureau," CFPB general counsel Mary McLeod writes in a draft of the memo, obtained by Politico.
