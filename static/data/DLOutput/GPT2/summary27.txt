UPDATE (10:50 pm ET): President Donald Trump said he will not immediately quit NAFTA, according to a White House statement released late Wednesday evening.
"It is my privilege to bring NAFTA up to date through renegotiation.
It is an honor to deal with both President Pena Nieto and Prime Minister Trudeau, and I believe that the end result will make all three countries stronger and better," Trump said in the statement.
