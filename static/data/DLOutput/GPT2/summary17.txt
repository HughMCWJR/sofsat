Roger Ailes, who spent decades advising political candidates and presidents about the power of television in American life before building Fox News into a media juggernaut -- and who left that network last summer following multiple allegations that he pressured female subordinates to have sexual relationships with him -- has died.
Following a lawsuit filed in July by former "Fox & Friends" co-host Gretchen Carlson, dozens of women claimed that Ailes sexually harassed them at various points in his political and media career.
Bush paid his respects to Ailes via Twitter on Thursday.)
