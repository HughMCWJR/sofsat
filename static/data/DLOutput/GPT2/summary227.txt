In a stinging rebuke of President Donald Trump's controversial decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel earlier this month, 128 countries, including some of the US's most trusted and reliable allies, voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of his position.
Though the resolution doesn't explicitly refer to the US, it's clearly directed at the White House.
It also "calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem" -- another shot at the administration, which announced plans to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
