SEOUL, South Korea -- The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has vowed to build up his country's nuclear arsenal as a "powerful deterrent" to the United States, state media reported, hours after President Trump said that "only one thing will work" in dealing with the isolated country.
If China continues to be a trading partner with North Korea and assures their safety against an attack, Kim Jong-Un has no excuse to continue his nuclear ambitions.
The next and best alternative solution is for Kim Jong-Un to be removed from power from within North Korea by moderate forces if they exist.
