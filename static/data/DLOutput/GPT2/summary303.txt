"I think there's been, at times, a disconnect between the way we see the president and how much we love the president and the way some of you perhaps see the president," Mr. Scaramucci said during a news conference that kicked off with his announcement of Ms. Sanders's new job.
Mr. Scaramucci's appointment came two months after the previous communications director, Mike Dubke, stepped down as the official in charge of Mr. Trump's messaging.
Mr. Trump, aggravated by their opposition, dressed the pair down in a testy Oval Office exchange around the time he decided to offer Mr. Scaramucci -- known in Trump's circle as "The Mooch" -- the job.
