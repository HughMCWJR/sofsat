The Russian government successfully obtained access to U.S. voter registration databases in multiple states prior to the 2016 election, the federal official responsible for monitoring hacking said.
"We were able to determine that the scanning and probing of voter registration databases was coming from the Russian government," Manfra added.
Five states, including Texas and California, denied that they ever suffered attacks.
