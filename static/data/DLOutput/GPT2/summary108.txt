"Sustained incumbency is not the point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles," said Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, of Arizona, in a searing speech.
But in choosing to retire rather than run for reelection, Flake is sending the worst possible message to his colleagues, empowering the president he loathes, and accelerating the takeover of the Republican Party that he laments.
America does not need Flake's courageous retirement.
