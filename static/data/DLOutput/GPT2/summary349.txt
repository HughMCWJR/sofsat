Kerry's Blunt Words for Israel Denounced by Lawmakers in Both Parties Image "Secretary Kerry's speech today was at best a pointless tirade in the waning days of an outgoing administration," Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on Wednesday.
Republicans denounced what they said was the Obama administration's harsh treatment of a steadfast ally and Democrats signaled that they were uneasy with Mr. Kerry's pressure on Israel, even as they praised the effort to promote Middle East peace.
"While he may not have intended it, I fear Secretary Kerry, in his speech and action at the U.N., has emboldened extremists on both sides," said Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate Democratic leader.
