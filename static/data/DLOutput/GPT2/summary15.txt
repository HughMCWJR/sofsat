JERUSALEM -- President Trump began a two-day visit to Israel on Monday with a blunt assessment for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: If Israel really wants peace with its Arab neighbors, the cost will be resolving the generations-old standoff with the Palestinians.
But as Mr. Trump arrived in Jerusalem after meetings in Saudi Arabia, the president indicated that he and those Arab states see an agreement with the Palestinians as integral to that new regional alignment.
"There is a growing realization among your Arab neighbors that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by Iran," Trump said, speaking earlier alongside Israeli President Reuven Rivlin.
