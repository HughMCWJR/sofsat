Authorities in Britain said Masood, the London suspect, had recently been living in the West Midlands in central England, was known by several aliases and had previously been investigated by the MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence agency.
Two people were killed and more than 30 others injured before the attacker fatally stabbed police officer Keith Palmer on the Parliament's grounds.
