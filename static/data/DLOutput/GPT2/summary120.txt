Donald Trump's comments about the NFL are starting to make Rush Limbaugh feel nervous, the conservative radio host said on his show Wednesday.
But I don't think that it is useful or helpful for any employee anywhere to be forced to do something because the government says they must," Limbaugh added.
Limbaugh's comments came after Trump tweeted on Wednesday suggesting NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was demanding players stand for the national anthem, following a number of players taking a knee to protest police brutality against African Americans.
