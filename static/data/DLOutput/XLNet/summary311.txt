Sean Hannity kicked off his Tuesday night show interviewing Donald Trump Jr. with a scathing attack on the mainstream media, calling members of the press "overpaid, lazy, rigid, left-wing ideologues."
The Fox News host sat down with the president's eldest son, who had tweeted out an email exchange from last year that showed he was connected with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who said she had damaging information obtained by the Russian government about then-presidential rival Hillary Clinton.
Knowing that a large audience would tune in, he used the opportunity to attack the media for their coverage of the president's administration and failure to report on what Hannity considered more important stories.
