WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers on Capitol Hill broadly agreed on Tuesday that something should be done about young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and who will eventually lose deportation protections if Congress does not step in to help them.
"Hopefully there will be some give and take and we can accomplish something," Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) That time period gives Congress time to pass its own measures to allow undocumented young people to stay in the country, something that a majority of Americans support.
Most Republicans in Congress have previously opposed such measures.
