Robert Vaudry, 52, a fund manager from Stratford-upon-Avon, said he had emerged from the Westminster subway station around 2:40 p.m. for a meeting with a lawmaker when he realized that something was amiss.
As he spoke, police officers were cordoning off the area.
One officer shouted, "We need everyone to move back past Downing Street."
