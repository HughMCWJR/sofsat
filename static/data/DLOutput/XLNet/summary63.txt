Give them credit for this one: Democrats have fought hard to stop Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump's blazingly unqualified pick for education secretary.
Sen. Tim Kaine cited the moment, during her hearing, when he asked DeVos if she would hold all schools that receive any taxpayer funding equally accountable, be they public, private, or charter, and she dodged the question repeatedly:
"But if you hold public schools accountable while you're taking some of their money away and you give that money to private schools, and you don't hold them accountable, you're not promoting fair competition," he said. "
The less serious, though mostly accurate, one is that she is plainly inexperienced.
