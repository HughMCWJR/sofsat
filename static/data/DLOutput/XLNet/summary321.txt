WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's commission on election integrity is facing significant hurdles, as multiple state election officials have said they will not comply with the panel's request this week for specific, sensitive voter information.
Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission's vice chair who signed the letter sent to the states on Wednesday, told the Kansas City Star that his state would not release the last four digits of voters' Social Security numbers because that information is not publicly available.
Kobach now says Kansas won't be sharing the last 4 social.
