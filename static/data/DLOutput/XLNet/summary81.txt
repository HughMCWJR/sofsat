The idea to insert the Obamacare mandate repeal is intended as a compromise.
Senate Republicans on Tuesday revised their tax cut bill to include a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate -- a bold move that frees up more money for deeper tax cuts and takes a whack at the health care law they have repeatedly tried but failed to repeal.
"We're optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican.
