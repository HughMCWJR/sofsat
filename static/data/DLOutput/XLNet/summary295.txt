On Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford informed the military that the Pentagon would not implement a ban on transgender troops "until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance."
In June of 2016, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that already-serving transgender troops could come out without fear of discharge.
He also established a plan to let openly transgender people enroll in the military within one year.
