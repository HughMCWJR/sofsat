Supervisors Vote 10-1 To Rename Columbus Day To Indigenous Peoples' Day
SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)
San Francisco supervisors today voted 10-1 to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples' Day despite a last-minute effort to delay the vote in response to objections from some members of the city's Italian-American community.
Other cities including Berkeley have changed Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples' Day in recognition of objections by Native American groups to a celebration of European colonization.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:
San Francisco's Board of Supervisors just voted to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples day as a means of honoring those people -- those Indians-slash-Native-Americans-slash-Aboriginals-slash-indigenous-slash-what-have-you people -- who lived in this country prior to its European settlement.
