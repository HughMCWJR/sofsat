A letter from the University of Chicago's dean of students to the incoming students of the class of 2020 has been making the rounds on social media the past few days.
What this means in practice, the letter continues, is that "we do not condone the creation of intellectual 'safe spaces' where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own."
And that's what this dean and the anti-trigger-warnings, no-safe-spaces crowd are counting on -- that the surface veneer of reasonableness in these admonitions to the class of 2020 will obscure the rotten pedagogy and logical fallacies that infest this entire screed.
