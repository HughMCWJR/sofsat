Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, had said earlier in the week that he feared that Mr. Trump would play politics with the dueling memos.
The Democratic memo was drawn from the same underlying documents as the Republican one.
Representative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the biggest champion of the Republican memo, said in a statement that he "had warned that the Democratic memo" revealed intelligence sources and methods, and that "it's no surprise that these agencies recommended against publishing the memo without redactions."
