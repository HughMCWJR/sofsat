President Donald Trump condemned hate groups, including white supremacists, in remarks from the White House on Monday, after receiving criticism for his initial statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.
"That is his unequivocal position," said Sessions.
Trump did not use the term "terrorism" during his speech on Monday.
