Alabama is the latest state to bear bad news to recipients of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), warning families Monday that it will no longer enroll children starting Jan. 1, 2018 and will terminate the program entirely on Feb. 1, 2018 if Congress fails to act.
In 20 states, CHIP also covers pregnant women.)
The state-administered program is jointly financed, and federal money accounts for more of the share -- between 65 to 85 percent.
