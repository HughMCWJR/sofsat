Puerto Rico will receive humanitarian crisis relief from the poverty group Oxfam, which has slammed the Trump administration's "slow and inadequate" response to the unfolding crisis.
Oxfam International typically provides aid to the world's most impoverished regions but now says it will help Puerto Rico, a rare rebuke from the charity--and one that equates the U.S. response to that of a Third World or war-torn nation such as Syria or Bangladesh.
Maxman said that response left her "outraged" at the U.S. government's failure to address the most urgent needs of Puerto Ricans who remain without electricity and clean water.
