President Trump is expected to take two steps to begin the upending of American trade policy very soon--perhaps as soon as Monday.
One, an executive order withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Barack Obama championed, is expected to be issued Monday according to CNN's Jake Tapper.
Mr. Trump could end the U.S. participation with 11 other Pacific Rim nations with the stroke of a pen because Congress had not ratified the ambitious accord despite strong support from business groups and President Obama.
