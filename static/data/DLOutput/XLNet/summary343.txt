President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed Friday on a report prepared by the U.S. intelligence community on Russian hacking activities in the presidential election -- after he spent this week still questioning the veracity of their previous assessments.
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday, Clapper previewed some of the report's findings.
"I think the incoming administration needs to take a strong stance against what has happened," he told reporters.
