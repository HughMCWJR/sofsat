Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has officially secured a majority of GOP delegates, giving him the "magic number" required to clinch the GOP nomination.
Earlier in the race, Trump foes within the Republican Party hoped to prevent him from reaching the so-called "magic number" of a majority of delegates, forcing a contested nomination process that would have prompted a potentially chaotic power struggle between different factions of the GOP on the convention floor.
Among them is Oklahoma GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard.
