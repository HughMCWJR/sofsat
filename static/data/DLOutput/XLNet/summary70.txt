Barack Obama's administration handed the Palestinians $221 million (PS177 million) on his last day in office, officials say.
The U.S. State Department released the funds to the Palestinian Authority, the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas that presides over the West Bank.
It is meant to provide assistance for reform in the territories for any future Palestinian state.
