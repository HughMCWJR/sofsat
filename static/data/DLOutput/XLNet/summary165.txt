WASHINGTON -- Former President Barack Obama said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's decision to dismantle the program protecting young undocumented immigrants was "contrary to our spirit, and to common sense."
Obama said it was a "political decision, and a moral question" -- and one of basic decency.
It is self-defeating -- because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love.
