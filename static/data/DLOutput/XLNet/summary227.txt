In a stinging rebuke of President Donald Trump's controversial decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel earlier this month, 128 countries, including some of the US's most trusted and reliable allies, voted in favor of a United Nations resolution on Thursday calling for a reversal of his position.
While the passage of the resolution isn't binding -- meaning the US doesn't actually have to reverse its position -- it's a stark illustration of just how isolated the United States is in its stance toward Israel.
The administration made a concerted effort to swing countries to its side before the UN vote.
