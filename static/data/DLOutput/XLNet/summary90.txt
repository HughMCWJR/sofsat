Syria took a break on Tuesday from its gruesome six-year civil war to announce plans to sign the Paris climate agreement, leaving the United States as the only country to reject the emissions-cutting deal.
The U.S. took a lead role in shaping the deal.
Only war-torn Syria and Nicaragua, which protested the agreement's failure to impose strict demands on major polluters, refused to sign.
