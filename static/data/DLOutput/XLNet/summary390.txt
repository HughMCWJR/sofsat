WASHINGTON -- Congress delivered a powerful rebuke to President Barack Obama on Wednesday by overriding his veto of a bill allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged ties to the terrorist attacks.
It's the first time one of Obama's vetoes has been overruled.
The bill now automatically becomes law without the president's signature.
