Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire on 22,000 concertgoers from his room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas around 10 p.m. on Sunday night.
Police could not immediately determine a motive for the attack.
The tense feeling hovering over the main casino floor was offset by friendly staff ready for gamblers to resume their usual activities.
