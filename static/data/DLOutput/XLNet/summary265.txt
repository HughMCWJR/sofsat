Last Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) made some stunning comments to local media assessing President's Donald Trump's performance over the first seven months of his term.
"The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful," Corker said.
And so Thursday, she was asked to comment on the words of the Republican Senator from Tennessee -- specifically Corker's statement criticizing the President's "competence."
