Donald Trump had one more surprise up his sleeve.
The result is a disaster for the Democratic Party, which had put its faith in a repeat candidate representing a fading dynasty, could not win the Senate, and has few obvious young standard bearers waiting in the wings; the traditional conservative wing of the Republican Party, which largely broke with Trump; the media, which plainly detested Trump but fueled his movement with incessant coverage; and the political consulting and polling industry, which saw its methods ridiculed.
His unfavorable ratings lagged far behind even Clinton's shoddy numbers, and national exit polls found a majority of Americans did not believe Trump was qualified to be president.
