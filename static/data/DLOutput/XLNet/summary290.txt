President Trump had previously caused concern among NATO members by saying the organization was "obsolete" and declining to promise that America would defend fellow members if they did not up their military spending.
No other president since NATO was founded in 1949 had questioned that principle -- until Trump, although he recently expressed support for NATO's Article 5.
