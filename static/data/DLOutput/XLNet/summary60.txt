WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies have confirmed that President Donald Trump's campaign aides and associates had constant contact with Russian intelligence officials before the election, directly contradicting public statements made by top administration officials.
"There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period," Spicer said.
Pence has been left to uncomfortably defend other Trump administration officials before.
