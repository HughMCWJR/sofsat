President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intensifying a feud with his own party's congressional leaders.
The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years, he failed!That should NEVER have happened!
-- McConnell may not have a majority to lead without Trump's help.
