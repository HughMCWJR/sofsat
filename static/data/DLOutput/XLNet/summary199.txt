The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ruled that the state's congressional map went so far to benefit Republicans that it "clearly, plainly and palpably" violated the state constitution.
Republicans controlled the redistricting process in 2010 and drew the map to give them a considerable advantage.
Should the parties fail to reach an agreement on the plan, the justices said the court would move quickly on its own to develop a constitutional congressional map.
