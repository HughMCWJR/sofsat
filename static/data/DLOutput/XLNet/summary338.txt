The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Hawaii judge's ruling barring Donald Trump's travel ban -- which would prevent all entries from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days, and nearly all refugee admissions for 120 days -- from going into effect on Monday.
The Supreme Court is now the last hope for the controversial executive order that sparked mass protests at airports around the country.
The Ninth Circuit's ruling says the government should be allowed to resume its review of visa procedures -- which is intended to lead to new "extreme vetting" tests for people seeking to enter the US -- which the Trump administration had argued it hadn't been able to do thanks to a lower-court order.
