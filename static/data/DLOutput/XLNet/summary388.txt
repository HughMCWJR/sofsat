"Lewd" was apparently not a strong enough word for the editors of The Washington Post when they tried to describe the contents of a recording they had acquired, in which Donald J. Trump is heard in a 2005 conversation with Billy Bush, the Access Hollywood host; they went with "extremely lewd" in their headline.
But "lewd," extremely or not, fails to capture the full essence of that recording.
Lewd can be fine, if whatever it is describing is consensual and no minors are involved.
