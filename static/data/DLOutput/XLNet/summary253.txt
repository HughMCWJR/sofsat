On Thursday, Mr. Lauer issued an apology, expressing "sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused."
But it was the formal complaint on Monday that prompted NBC to take action.
Other "Today" hosts learned of Mr. Lauer's termination around 4 a.m. on Wednesday; staff members were told just minutes before the show went on the air at 7 a.m. Savannah Guthrie, Mr. Lauer's co-anchor, was visibly shaken when she delivered the news to viewers, describing Mr. Lauer as "a dear, dear friend" and adding that she was "heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story."
