VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged U.S. President Donald Trump to be a peacemaker at their highly anticipated first meeting on Wednesday, and Trump promised he would not forget the pontiff's message.
Part of Trump's motivation for meeting the pope was to dramatize how the three major religions should rally against the threat from Islamist militants.
Netanyahu for his part thanked the U.S. president for a speech "that in so few words said so much."
