President Donald Trump on Thursday lashed out at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?"
"Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that [lawmakers] haven't done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point," he said.
And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process."
