President Trump is throwing his support behind Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his immigration legislation, as the debate over immigration reform continues to play out on Capitol Hill.
Grassley had previously introduced "The Secure and Succeed Act" with Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.
It takes a tougher stance on illegal immigration enforcement and addresses the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, allowing beneficiaries to be eligible for 3-year renewable permits to stay in the U.S.
Of the 70 security points included in the Trump administration's immigration wish list sent to Congress in October, half -- 35 -- are not included in Goodlatte's bill.
