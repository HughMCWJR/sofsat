Roger Ailes, who spent decades advising political candidates and presidents about the power of television in American life before building Fox News into a media juggernaut -- and who left that network last summer following multiple allegations that he pressured female subordinates to have sexual relationships with him -- has died.
There are several ongoing lawsuits, and federal investigators are still determining whether 21st Century Fox, the network's parent company led by the Murdoch family, properly notified investors about payments to Ailes' accusers.
In his telling, Ailes convinced the TV-averse Nixon that he needed to embrace the new medium.
