It's no great credit to Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he finally recused himself from all Justice Department investigations relating to the 2016 presidential campaign -- and specifically from all current or future inquiries into Russian attempts to influence the election.
As it turns out, Mr.
Sessions met twice with Mr. Kislyak, once at the Republican National Convention in July, and again in his Senate office in September -- around the time that Russian efforts to meddle in the election on behalf of Mr. Trump reached their peak.
