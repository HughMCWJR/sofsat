Donald Trump's approval rating has reached a historic new low in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, with almost half of Americans believing the country to be weaker since he took office.
Sixty percent said they believe Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election, up four points from April.
Overall, 48 percent now say they "strongly disapprove" of Trump, a level never reached by former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and only by George W. Bush in his second term.
