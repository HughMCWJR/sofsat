Congressional Republicans on Monday recrafted their Obamacare replacement bill in hopes of satisfying critics as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to promote his first major legislative initiative on Capitol Hill.
Trump met on Monday at the White House with Ryan, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Zeke Emanuel, an architect of Obama's healthcare law, to discuss the issue.
CBO's last report on the bill a week ago severely damaged its prospects.
