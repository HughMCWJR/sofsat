As delegates streamed out, a handful of Mr. Sanders's most dedicated supporters held up his signs and chanted, "Hey, hey, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary."
Mr. Sanders, who took the stage here at about 10:50 p.m. to a thundering three-minute ovation and chants of "Bernie, Bernie," acknowledged the disappointment of his supporters and said, "It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues."
Throughout the day, more than 1,000 supporters of Mr. Sanders took to the scalding streets of Philadelphia to vent their frustration.
