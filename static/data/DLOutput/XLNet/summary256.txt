The deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued the Trump administration on Sunday to block the president's appointment of Mick Mulvaney as interim director of the agency.
The law establishing the CFPB stipulates the director of the agency shall appoint a deputy director who will "serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the director."
Such an individual will serve until the president appoints and the Senate confirms a new director.
