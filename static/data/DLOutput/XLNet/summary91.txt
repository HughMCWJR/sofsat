A day after a gunman massacred parishioners in a small Texas church, the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to enter the man's domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the rifle he used to kill 26 people.
Under federal law, the conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and toddler stepson -- he had cracked the child's skull -- should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he acquired in the last four years.
It was a domestic situation going on," Mr. Martin added.
