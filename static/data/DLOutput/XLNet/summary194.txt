DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Trump sought to repair one diplomatic rift while widening another on Thursday as he smoothed over months of friction with Britain but threatened to cut financial aid to the Palestinians after they withdrew from peace discussions.

President Trump touched down in Switzerland early Thursday, where he intends to bring his "America First" message to a skeptical - and possibly hostile - gathering of global political and business leaders at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos.
