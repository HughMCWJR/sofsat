JERUSALEM -- President Trump began a two-day visit to Israel on Monday with a blunt assessment for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: If Israel really wants peace with its Arab neighbors, the cost will be resolving the generations-old standoff with the Palestinians.
The pleasantries between the two continued as the Israeli leader told Trump "how much we appreciate the change in American policy on Iran" and the "reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East."
The Iranian threat has been a chief theme of the U.S. president's remarks as he seeks to reassure Middle East allies and bring them together toward common goals -- including the "rare opportunity" of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.
