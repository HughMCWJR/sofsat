Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office is not staying silent following explosive accusations by a lawyer for President Donald Trump's transition team that the investigators looking into claims of collusion with Moscow during the campaign unlawfully received tens of thousands of emails from the General Services Administration.
Mueller's spokesman isn't the only one pushing back.
GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt also contradicted the claims made by Trump's transition team.
