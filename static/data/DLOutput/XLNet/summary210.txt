A lawyer for President Donald Trump arranged a payment of $130,000 to a former adult film actress in October 2016, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal citing sources familiar with the matter.
Clifford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The deal would have been reached around the same time a leaked recording revealed the now-infamous lewd comments Trump made on the set of "Access Hollywood" in 2005.
