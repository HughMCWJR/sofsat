President Trump portrayed a very dark picture of America during a speech on Friday that returned to one of his favorite themes from the campaign: Immigrants are bringing drugs, crime, and violence to the US and must be stopped.
He called gang members "animals" and repeatedly said police are "liberating" multiple towns and cities across the United States.
I was reading one of these animals was caught and explaining they like to knife them and cut them and let them die slowly because that way it's more painful.
