In a brief statement, Mr. Cooper -- whose razor-thin victory over Mr. McCrory in November was due in large part to voter frustration over the national backlash over House Bill 2 -- said, "I support the House Bill 2 repeal compromise that will be introduced tomorrow.
It's not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation."
Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said that the compromise would leave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people with no statewide anti-discrimination ordinance and no ability to seek such protections from local government for a number of years.
