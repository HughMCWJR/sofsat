WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are moving quickly toward a vote on their tax proposal this week, with GOP leaders still tweaking the bill to win over reluctant Republicans.
There are a number of other senators who seem to have serious reservations about the bill, and, if every Democrat votes no, as expected, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) Johnson and Daines are typically reliable Republican votes who likely will support the tax proposal in its final form.
Collins and Murkowski were tight-lipped Monday, but Murkowski has shown some willingness to vote for the tax proposal -- even if it includes the individual mandate repeal -- as long as the bill also opens up parts of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and natural gas drilling.
