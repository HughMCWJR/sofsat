One of President Donald Trump's judicial nominees -- a man who, if confirmed, would sit on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for life -- failed to answer basic legal questions during his confirmation hearing on Thursday night.
Matthew Spencer Petersen, who currently serves as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission, was questioned by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., Kennedy then asked about motion in limine, which is a motion made at the beginning of a trial to exclude certain evidence.
After initially giving the appearance that he knew the answer to that question, Petersen had to admit when pressed that he did not.
