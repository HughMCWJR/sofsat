President Donald Trump slammed Iran Friday, calling the country a "menace" and announced new sanctions against its regime -- but did not take action to alter the Obama-era nuclear deal that he has denounced since his presidential campaign.
While the president portrayed the decision as having originated with his administration, he acknowledged that Congress holds the key to the deal's future.
Tehran and world powers in July 2015 crafted a deal that eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for stepped-up international monitoring of its nuclear development activities.
