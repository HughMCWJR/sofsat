President Donald Trump has terminated his long-troubled voter fraud commission.
The commission was headed by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the latter of whom has a particularly prominent history of advocating for new restrictions on voting.
Touting these kinds of concerns, 23 states have enacted new voting restrictions -- from strict photo ID requirements to new limits on early voting -- since the end of 2010, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
