WASHINGTON -- The Jones Act waiver for Puerto Rico expired Sunday night, and "it is not being extended at this time," Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan told HuffPost on Monday.
DHS had temporarily waived the Jones Act -- an arguably outdated law that imposes exorbitant shipping costs on the U.S. island -- on Sept. 28.
The return to higher shipping costs won't help Puerto Rico as it tries to climb out of economic devastation.
