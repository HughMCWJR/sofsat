WASHINGTON -- As one of their first actions in the new Congress, House Republicans are planning to significantly change the Office of Congressional Ethics, removing the entity's independence, barring it from investigating anonymous complaints and even changing the group's name.
The new group would no longer be able to release information to the public, employ anyone "for a position involving communications with the public," or directly contact law enforcement without approval.
Republicans themselves defended the changes as necessary adjustments to protect members from political witch hunts.
