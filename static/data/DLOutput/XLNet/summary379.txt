A new report out tonight says that there were some pretty fierce internal tensions between FBI investigators and Justice Department officials over whether they had enough to pursue an "aggressive" investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
The Wall Street Journal put out this new report tonight days after the paper reported that the FBI investigation may have been shut down completely by the DOJ.
His defenders deny that, and say it was the Justice Department that kept pushing back on the investigation.
