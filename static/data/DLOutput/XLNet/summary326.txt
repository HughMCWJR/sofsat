It's hard to miss the fundamental design of the Senate's health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare: a bill that makes deep cuts to services for low-income Americans to pay for tax cuts that would largely benefit the country's wealthiest.
The Congressional Budget Office's report now confirms it: Medicaid, a health service for poorer Americans, as well as the disabled and elderly, would see a $772 billion cut over the next 10 years.
Vox's Sarah Kliff explained this major change in the programs:
This bill would convert Medicaid to a "per capita cap" system, where states would get a lump sum from the federal government for each enrollee.
