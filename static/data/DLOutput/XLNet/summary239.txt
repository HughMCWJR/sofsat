Today, the Treasury Department finally released its much-promised analysis of its tax plan.
And it turns out, they can't deliver what they promised.
Instead of a dynamic analysis showing that the tax plan would boost annual economic growth by the 0.7 percentage points they need, they have an analysis claiming that if you passed that tax plan and did a bunch of other stuff you will get the growth (emphasis added):
[Office of Tax Policy] compared this 2.9% GDP growth scenario to a baseline of previous projections of 2.2% GDP growth.
