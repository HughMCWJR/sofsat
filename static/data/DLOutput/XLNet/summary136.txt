Royal Caribbean is pitching in on hurricane relief in any way it can.
The cruise line has canceled its Sept. 30 Adventure of the Seas trip so it can focus the ship on helping with relief from Hurricane Maria, along with Hurricane Irma, which passed through just weeks before.
It's also operating only a limited number of flights.
