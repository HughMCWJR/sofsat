Over the weekend, activists descended on Berkeley, California, and attacked peaceful protesters.
The argument for antifa activists is that the current crop of right-wing protesters -- which are partly but not entirely made up of neo-Nazis, KKK members, and other white supremacists and nationalists -- are so extreme that they must be stopped swiftly and even violently.
When far-left protesters act violently, it gives Trump and other conservatives more ammunition to draw equivalencies between the far left and far right -- even if it is a false equivalence, given that America has a long history of racist violence and very little, by comparison, of left-wing violence.
