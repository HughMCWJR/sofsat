Rep. Al Green (D-TX) became the first member of Congress to officially read articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on the floor on Wednesday -- and the president's Twitter account is at the center of Trump's alleged "crimes and misdemeanors."
Green read the articles of impeachment on the House floor but did not formally introduce them.
He told Vox he wanted to give members of Congress and the public "an opportunity to read them" before a vote.
