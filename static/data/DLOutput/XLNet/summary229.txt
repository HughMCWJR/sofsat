The Senate early Wednesday passed the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax-cut plan, putting it closer to President Trump's desk with an additional House vote expected Wednesday.
The Senate passed the slightly modified plan on a 51-48 vote after the House passed its bill earlier in the day on a 227-203 vote.
The action will complete a once-unthinkable timeline to get a tax bill through Congress before Christmas, and comes less than two months after House Republicans released their initial legislative text of the tax bill.
