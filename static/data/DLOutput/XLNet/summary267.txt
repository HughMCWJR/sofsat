Donald Trump has sought to portray himself as the true victim of the deadly events in Charlottesville, launching an all-out assault on the media and branding journalists who "do not like our country" as the true source of division in America.
He re-read three statements he made in the wake of the tragedy and, deploying authoritarian rhetoric, declared: "It's time to expose the crooked media deceptions and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions and yes, by the way, they are trying to take away our history and our heritage."
